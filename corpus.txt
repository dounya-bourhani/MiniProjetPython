Titre du document Arxiv : A Big Data Based Framework for Executing Complex Query Over COVID-19
  Datasets (COVID-QF)
Auteur : ['Eman A. Khashan', 'Ali I. Eldesouky', 'M. Fadel', 'Sally M. Elghamrawy']
Texte : COVID-19's rapid global spread has driven innovative tools for Big Data
Analytics. These have guided organizations in all fields of the health industry
to track and minimized the effects of virus. Researchers are required to detect
coronaviruses through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural
language processing, and to gain a complete understanding of the disease.
COVID-19 takes place in different countries in the world, with which only big
data application and the work of NOSQL databases are suitable. There is a great
number of platforms used for processing NOSQL Databases model like: Spark, H2O
and Hadoop HDFS/MapReduce, which are proper to control and manage the enormous
amount of data. Many challenges faced by large applications programmers,
especially those that work on the COVID-19 databases through hybrid data models
through different APIs and query. In this context, this paper proposes a
storage framework to handle both SQL and NOSQL databases named (COVID-QF) for
COVID-19 datasets in order to treat and handle the problems caused by virus
spreading worldwide by reducing treatment times. In case of NoSQL database,
COVID-QF uses Hadoop HDFS/Map Reduce and Apache Spark. The COVID-QF consists of
three Layers: data collection layer, storage layer, and query Processing layer.
The data is collected in the data collection layer. The storage layer divides
data into collection of data-saving and processing blocks, and it connects the
Connector of the spark with different databases engine to reduce time of saving
and retrieving. While the Processing layer executes the request query and sends
results. The proposed framework used three datasets increased for time for
COVID-19 data (COVID-19-Merging, COVID-19-inside-Hubei and COVID-19-ex-Hubei)
to test experiments of this study. The results obtained insure the superiority
of the COVID-QF framework.

Titre du document Arxiv : A High-Resolution Chest CT-Scan Image Dataset for COVID-19 Diagnosis and
  Differentiation
Auteur : ['Iraj Abedi', 'Mahsa Vali', 'Bentolhoda Otroshi Shahreza', 'Hamidreza Bolhasani']
Texte : During the COVID-19 pandemic, computed tomography (CT) is a good way to
diagnose COVID-19 patients. HRCT (High-Resolution Computed Tomography) is a
form of computed tomography that uses advanced methods to improve image
resolution. Publicly accessible COVID-19 CT image datasets are very difficult
to come by due to privacy concerns, which impedes the study and development of
AI-powered COVID-19 diagnostic algorithms based on CT images. To address this
problem, we have introduced HRCTv1-COVID-19, a new COVID-19 high resolution
chest CT Scan image dataset that includes not only COVID-19 cases of Ground
Glass Opacity (GGO), Crazy Paving, and Air Space Consolidation, but also CT
images of cases with negative COVID-19. The HRCTv1-COVID-19 dataset, which
includes slice-level, and patient-level labels, has the potential to aid
COVID-19 research, especially for diagnosis and differentiation using
artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning and deep learning methods.
This dataset is accessible through web at: http://databiox.com and includes
181,106 chest HRCT images from 395 patients with four labels: GGO, Crazy
Paving, Air Space Consolidation and Negative.
  Keywords- Dataset, COVID-19, CT-Scan, Computed Tomography, Medical Imaging,
Chest Image.

Titre du document Arxiv : A machine learning analysis of the relationship between some underlying
  medical conditions and COVID-19 susceptibility
Auteur : ['Mostafa Rezapour', 'Colin A. Varady']
Texte : For the past couple years, the Coronavirus, commonly known as COVID-19, has
significantly affected the daily lives of all citizens residing in the United
States by imposing several, fatal health risks that cannot go unnoticed. In
response to the growing fear and danger COVID-19 inflicts upon societies in the
USA, several vaccines and boosters have been created as a permanent remedy for
individuals to take advantage of. In this paper, we investigate the
relationship between the COVID-19 vaccines and boosters and the total case
count for the Coronavirus across multiple states in the USA. Additionally, this
paper discusses the relationship between several, selected underlying health
conditions with COVID-19. To discuss these relationships effectively, this
paper will utilize statistical tests and machine learning methods for analysis
and discussion purposes. Furthermore, this paper reflects upon conclusions made
about the relationship between educational attainment, race, and COVID-19 and
the possible connections that can be established with underlying health
conditions, vaccination rates, and COVID-19 total case and death counts.

Titre du document Arxiv : A novel unsupervised covid lung lesion segmentation based on the lung
  tissue identification
Auteur : ['Faeze Gholamian Khah', 'Samaneh Mostafapour', 'Seyedjafar Shojaerazavi', 'Nouraddin Abdi-Goushbolagh', 'Hossein Arabi']
Texte : This study aimed to evaluate the performance of a novel unsupervised deep
learning-based framework for automated infections lesion segmentation from CT
images of Covid patients. In the first step, two residual networks were
independently trained to identify the lung tissue for normal and Covid patients
in a supervised manner. These two models, referred to as DL-Covid and DL-Norm
for Covid-19 and normal patients, respectively, generate the voxel-wise
probability maps for lung tissue identification. To detect Covid lesions, the
CT image of the Covid patient is processed by the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models
to obtain two lung probability maps. Since the DL-Norm model is not familiar
with Covid infections within the lung, this model would assign lower
probabilities to the lesions than the DL-Covid. Hence, the probability maps of
the Covid infections could be generated through the subtraction of the two lung
probability maps obtained from the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models. Manual lesion
segmentation of 50 Covid-19 CT images was used to assess the accuracy of the
unsupervised lesion segmentation approach. The Dice coefficients of 0.985 and
0.978 were achieved for the lung segmentation of normal and Covid patients in
the external validation dataset, respectively. Quantitative results of
infection segmentation by the proposed unsupervised method showed the Dice
coefficient and Jaccard index of 0.67 and 0.60, respectively. Quantitative
evaluation of the proposed unsupervised approach for Covid-19 infectious lesion
segmentation showed relatively satisfactory results. Since this framework does
not require any annotated dataset, it could be used to generate very large
training samples for the supervised machine learning algorithms dedicated to
noisy and/or weakly annotated datasets.

Titre du document Arxiv : A review of Deep learning Techniques for COVID-19 identification on
  Chest CT images
Auteur : ['Briskline Kiruba S', 'Petchiammal A', 'D. Murugan']
Texte : The current COVID-19 pandemic is a serious threat to humanity that directly
affects the lungs. Automatic identification of COVID-19 is a challenge for
health care officials. The standard gold method for diagnosing COVID-19 is
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) to collect swabs from
affected people. Some limitations encountered while collecting swabs are
related to accuracy and longtime duration. Chest CT (Computed Tomography) is
another test method that helps healthcare providers quickly identify the
infected lung areas. It was used as a supporting tool for identifying COVID-19
in an earlier stage. With the help of deep learning, the CT imaging
characteristics of COVID-19. Researchers have proven it to be highly effective
for COVID-19 CT image classification. In this study, we review the recent deep
learning techniques that can use to detect the COVID-19 disease. Relevant
studies were collected by various databases such as Web of Science, Google
Scholar, and PubMed. Finally, we compare the results of different deep learning
models, and CT image analysis is discussed.

Titre du document Arxiv : Adaptive Feature Selection Guided Deep Forest for COVID-19
  Classification with Chest CT
Auteur : ['Liang Sun', 'Zhanhao Mo', 'Fuhua Yan', 'Liming Xia', 'Fei Shan', 'Zhongxiang Ding', 'Wei Shao', 'Feng Shi', 'Huan Yuan', 'Huiting Jiang', 'Dijia Wu', 'Ying Wei', 'Yaozong Gao', 'Wanchun Gao', 'He Sui', 'Daoqiang Zhang', 'Dinggang Shen']
Texte : Chest computed tomography (CT) becomes an effective tool to assist the
diagnosis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Due to the outbreak of COVID-19
worldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19
classification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of
clinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep
Forest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images.
Specifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then,
in order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the
relatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn
high-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature
selection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the
redundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively
incorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed
AFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of
community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN),
specificity (SPE) and AUC achieved by our method are 91.79%, 93.05%, 89.95% and
96.35%, respectively. Experimental results on the COVID-19 dataset suggest that
the proposed AFS-DF achieves superior performance in COVID-19 vs. CAP
classification, compared with 4 widely used machine learning methods.

Titre du document Arxiv : An Exploratory Characterization of Bugs in COVID-19 Software Projects
Auteur : ['Akond Rahman', 'Effat Farhana']
Texte : Context: The dire consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced
development of COVID-19 software i.e., software used for analysis and
mitigation of COVID-19. Bugs in COVID-19 software can be consequential, as
COVID-19 software projects can impact public health policy and user data
privacy. Objective: The goal of this paper is to help practitioners and
researchers improve the quality of COVID-19 software through an empirical study
of open source software projects related to COVID-19. Methodology: We use 129
open source COVID-19 software projects hosted on GitHub to conduct our
empirical study. Next, we apply qualitative analysis on 550 bug reports from
the collected projects to identify bug categories. Findings: We identify 8 bug
categories, which include data bugs i.e., bugs that occur during mining and
storage of COVID-19 data. The identified bug categories appear for 7 categories
of software projects including (i) projects that use statistical modeling to
perform predictions related to COVID-19, and (ii) medical equipment software
that are used to design and implement medical equipment, such as ventilators.
Conclusion: Based on our findings, we advocate for robust statistical model
construction through better synergies between data science practitioners and
public health experts. Existence of security bugs in user tracking software
necessitates development of tools that will detect data privacy violations and
security weaknesses.

Titre du document Arxiv : Artificial Intelligence Forecasting of Covid-19 in China
Auteur : ['Zixin Hu', 'Qiyang Ge', 'Shudi Li', 'Li Jin', 'Momiao Xiong']
Texte : BACKGROUND An alternative to epidemiological models for transmission dynamics
of Covid-19 in China, we propose the artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired
methods for real-time forecasting of Covid-19 to estimate the size, lengths and
ending time of Covid-19 across China. METHODS We developed a modified stacked
auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We
applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19
across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by
WHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms
to group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure.
RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across
China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting,
the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step
forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted
that the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the
forecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19,
2020. The 34 provinces/cities were grouped into 9 clusters. CONCLUSIONS The
accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was
high. We predicted that the epidemics of Covid-19 will be over by the middle of
April. If the data are reliable and there are no second transmissions, we can
accurately forecast the transmission dynamics of the Covid-19 across the
provinces/cities in China. The AI-inspired methods are a powerful tool for
helping public health planning and policymaking.

Titre du document Arxiv : Assess the impacts of human mobility change on COVID-19 dynamics in
  Arizona, U.S.: a modeling study incorporating Google Community Mobility
  Reports
Auteur : ['Nao Yamamoto', 'Haiyan Wang']
Texte : In June 2020, Arizona, U.S., emerged as one of the world's worst coronavirus
disease 2019(COVID-19) spots after the stay-at-home order was lifted in the
middle of May. However, with the decisions to reimpose restrictions, the number
of COVID-19 cases has been declining, and Arizona is considered to be a good
model in slowing the epidemic. In this paper, we aimed to examine the COVID-19
situation in Arizona and assess the impact of human mobility change. We
constructed the mobility integrated metapopulation
susceptible-infectious-removed model and fitted to publicly available datasets
on COVID-19 cases and mobility changes in Arizona. Our simulations showed that
by reducing human mobility, the peak time was delayed, and the final size of
the epidemic was decreased in all three regions. Our analysis suggests that
rapid and effective decision making is crucial to control human mobility and,
therefore, COVID-19 epidemics. Until a vaccine is available, reimplementations
of mobility restrictions in response to the increase of new COVID-19 cases
might need to be considered in Arizona and beyond.

Titre du document Arxiv : Automatic classification between COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19
  pneumonia, and the healthy on chest X-ray image: combination of data
  augmentation methods
Auteur : ['Mizuho Nishio', 'Shunjiro Noguchi', 'Hidetoshi Matsuo', 'Takamichi Murakami']
Texte : Purpose: This study aimed to develop and validate computer-aided diagnosis
(CXDx) system for classification between COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19
pneumonia, and the healthy on chest X-ray (CXR) images.
  Materials and Methods: From two public datasets, 1248 CXR images were
obtained, which included 215, 533, and 500 CXR images of COVID-19 pneumonia
patients, non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients, and the healthy samples. The
proposed CADx system utilized VGG16 as a pre-trained model and combination of
conventional method and mixup as data augmentation methods. Other types of
pre-trained models were compared with the VGG16-based model. Single type or no
data augmentation methods were also evaluated. Splitting of
training/validation/test sets was used when building and evaluating the CADx
system. Three-category accuracy was evaluated for test set with 125 CXR images.
  Results: The three-category accuracy of the CAD system was 83.6% between
COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy. Sensitivity for
COVID-19 pneumonia was more than 90%. The combination of conventional method
and mixup was more useful than single type or no data augmentation method.
  Conclusion: This study was able to create an accurate CADx system for the
3-category classification. Source code of our CADx system is available as open
source for COVID-19 research.

Titre du document Arxiv : Boosting Automatic COVID-19 Detection Performance with Self-Supervised
  Learning and Batch Knowledge Ensembling
Auteur : ['Guang Li', 'Ren Togo', 'Takahiro Ogawa', 'Miki Haseyama']
Texte : Background and objective: COVID-19 and its variants have caused significant
disruptions in over 200 countries and regions worldwide, affecting the health
and lives of billions of people. Detecting COVID-19 from chest X-Ray (CXR)
images has become one of the fastest and easiest methods for detecting COVID-19
since the common occurrence of radiological pneumonia findings in COVID-19
patients. We present a novel high-accuracy COVID-19 detection method that uses
CXR images. Methods: Our method consists of two phases. One is self-supervised
learning-based pertaining; the other is batch knowledge ensembling-based
fine-tuning. Self-supervised learning-based pretraining can learn distinguished
representations from CXR images without manually annotated labels. On the other
hand, batch knowledge ensembling-based fine-tuning can utilize category
knowledge of images in a batch according to their visual feature similarities
to improve detection performance. Unlike our previous implementation, we
introduce batch knowledge ensembling into the fine-tuning phase, reducing the
memory used in self-supervised learning and improving COVID-19 detection
accuracy. Results: On two public COVID-19 CXR datasets, namely, a large dataset
and an unbalanced dataset, our method exhibited promising COVID-19 detection
performance. Our method maintains high detection accuracy even when annotated
CXR training images are reduced significantly (e.g., using only 10% of the
original dataset). In addition, our method is insensitive to changes in
hyperparameters. Conclusions: The proposed method outperforms other
state-of-the-art COVID-19 detection methods in different settings. Our method
can reduce the workloads of healthcare providers and radiologists.

Titre du document Arxiv : Change point detection for COVID-19 excess deaths in Belgium
Auteur : ['Han Lin Shang', 'Ruofan Xu']
Texte : Emerging at the end of 2019, COVID-19 has become a public health threat to
people worldwide. Apart from the deaths who tested positive for COVID-19, many
others have died from causes indirectly related to COVID-19. Therefore, the
COVID-19 confirmed deaths underestimate the influence of the pandemic on the
society; instead, the measure of `excess deaths' is a more objective and
comparable way to assess the scale of the epidemic and formulate lessons. One
common practical issue in analyzing the impact of COVID-19 is to determine the
`pre-COVID-19' period and the `post-COVID-19' period. We apply a change point
detection method to identify any change points using the excess deaths in
Belgium.

Titre du document Arxiv : Citation premium: a much higher proportion of COVID-19 related
  publications become highly cited papers
Auteur : ['Weishu Liu', 'Haifeng Wang']
Texte : With the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists from various
disciplines responded quickly to this historical public health emergency. The
sudden boom of COVID-19 related papers in a short period of time may bring
unexpected influence to some commonly used bibliometric indicators. By a
large-scale investigation using Science Citation Index Expanded and Social
Sciences Citation Index, this study confirms the citation premium of COVID-19
related papers empirically. More than 8% of COVID-19 related papers published
during 2020 and 2021 were selected as Essential Science Indicators highly cited
papers, which was much higher than the set global benchmark value of 1%. The
citation premium of COVID-19 related papers for different Web of Science
categories/countries/journal impact factor quartiles were also demonstrated.
The distortions of COVID-19 related papers' citation premium to some
bibliometric indicators were discussed at the end of this brief communication.

Titre du document Arxiv : Classification Aware Neural Topic Model and its Application on a New
  COVID-19 Disinformation Corpus
Auteur : ['Xingyi Song', 'Johann Petrak', 'Ye Jiang', 'Iknoor Singh', 'Diana Maynard', 'Kalina Bontcheva']
Texte : The explosion of disinformation accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic has
overloaded fact-checkers and media worldwide, and brought a new major challenge
to government responses worldwide. Not only is disinformation creating
confusion about medical science amongst citizens, but it is also amplifying
distrust in policy makers and governments. To help tackle this, we developed
computational methods to categorise COVID-19 disinformation. The COVID-19
disinformation categories could be used for a) focusing fact-checking efforts
on the most damaging kinds of COVID-19 disinformation; b) guiding policy makers
who are trying to deliver effective public health messages and counter
effectively COVID-19 disinformation. This paper presents: 1) a corpus
containing what is currently the largest available set of manually annotated
COVID-19 disinformation categories; 2) a classification-aware neural topic
model (CANTM) designed for COVID-19 disinformation category classification and
topic discovery; 3) an extensive analysis of COVID-19 disinformation categories
with respect to time, volume, false type, media type and origin source.

Titre du document Arxiv : Classification of COVID-19 Patients with their Severity Level from Chest
  CT Scans using Transfer Learning
Auteur : ['Mansi Gupta', 'Aman Swaraj', 'Karan Verma']
Texte : Background and Objective: During pandemics, the use of artificial
intelligence (AI) approaches combined with biomedical science play a
significant role in reducing the burden on the healthcare systems and
physicians. The rapid increment in cases of COVID-19 has led to an increase in
demand for hospital beds and other medical equipment. However, since medical
facilities are limited, it is recommended to diagnose patients as per the
severity of the infection. Keeping this in mind, we share our research in
detecting COVID-19 as well as assessing its severity using chest-CT scans and
Deep Learning pre-trained models. Dataset: We have collected a total of 1966 CT
Scan images for three different class labels, namely, Non-COVID, Severe COVID,
and Non-Severe COVID, out of which 714 CT images belong to the Non-COVID
category, 713 CT images are for Non-Severe COVID category and 539 CT images are
of Severe COVID category. Methods: All of the images are initially
pre-processed using the Contrast Limited Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
approach. The pre-processed images are then fed into the VGG-16 network for
extracting features. Finally, the retrieved characteristics are categorized and
the accuracy is evaluated using a support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold
cross-validation (CV). Result and Conclusion: In our study, we have combined
well-known strategies for pre-processing, feature extraction, and
classification which brings us to a remarkable success rate of disease and its
severity recognition with an accuracy of 96.05% (97.7% for Non-Severe COVID-19
images and 93% for Severe COVID-19 images). Our model can therefore help
radiologists detect COVID-19 and the extent of its severity.

Titre du document Arxiv : Clustering COVID-19 Lung Scans
Auteur : ['Jacob Householder', 'Andrew Householder', 'John Paul Gomez-Reed', 'Fredrick Park', 'Shuai Zhang']
Texte : With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the characteristics of the
virus has become an important and challenging task in the scientific community.
While tests do exist for COVID-19, the goal of our research is to explore other
methods of identifying infected individuals. Our group applied unsupervised
clustering techniques to explore a dataset of lungscans of COVID-19 infected,
Viral Pneumonia infected, and healthy individuals. This is an important area to
explore as COVID-19 is a novel disease that is currently being studied in
detail. Our methodology explores the potential that unsupervised clustering
algorithms have to reveal important hidden differences between COVID-19 and
other respiratory illnesses. Our experiments use: Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), K-Means++ (KM++) and the recently developed Robust Continuous Clustering
algorithm (RCC). We evaluate the performance of KM++ and RCC in clustering
COVID-19 lung scans using the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) score.

Titre du document Arxiv : CML-COVID: A Large-Scale COVID-19 Twitter Dataset with Latent Topics,
  Sentiment and Location Information
Auteur : ['Hassan Dashtian', 'Dhiraj Murthy']
Texte : As a platform, Twitter has been a significant public space for discussion
related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Public social media platforms such as Twitter
represent important sites of engagement regarding the pandemic and these data
can be used by research teams for social, health, and other research.
Understanding public opinion about COVID-19 and how information diffuses in
social media is important for governments and research institutions. Twitter is
a ubiquitous public platform and, as such, has tremendous utility for
understanding public perceptions, behavior, and attitudes related to COVID-19.
In this research, we present CML-COVID, a COVID-19 Twitter data set of
19,298,967 million tweets from 5,977,653 unique individuals and summarize some
of the attributes of these data. These tweets were collected between March 2020
and July 2020 using the query terms coronavirus, covid and mask related to
COVID-19. We use topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and descriptive statistics
to describe the tweets related to COVID-19 we collected and the geographical
location of tweets, where available. We provide information on how to access
our tweet dataset (archived using twarc).

Titre du document Arxiv : CoAID: COVID-19 Healthcare Misinformation Dataset
Auteur : ['Limeng Cui', 'Dongwon Lee']
Texte : As the COVID-19 virus quickly spreads around the world, unfortunately,
misinformation related to COVID-19 also gets created and spreads like wild
fire. Such misinformation has caused confusion among people, disruptions in
society, and even deadly consequences in health problems. To be able to
understand, detect, and mitigate such COVID-19 misinformation, therefore, has
not only deep intellectual values but also huge societal impacts. To help
researchers combat COVID-19 health misinformation, therefore, we present CoAID
(Covid-19 heAlthcare mIsinformation Dataset), with diverse COVID-19 healthcare
misinformation, including fake news on websites and social platforms, along
with users' social engagement about such news. CoAID includes 4,251 news,
296,000 related user engagements, 926 social platform posts about COVID-19, and
ground truth labels. The dataset is available at:

Titre du document Arxiv : Collaboration in the Time of COVID: A Scientometric Analysis of
  Multidisciplinary SARS-CoV-2 Research
Auteur : ['Eoghan Cunningham', 'Barry Smyth', 'Derek Greene']
Texte : The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 illness it causes have
inspired unprecedented levels of multidisciplinary research in an effort to
address a generational public health challenge. In this work we conduct a
scientometric analysis of COVID-19 research, paying particular attention to the
nature of collaboration that this pandemic has fostered among different
disciplines. Increased multidisciplinary collaboration has been shown to
produce greater scientific impact, albeit with higher co-ordination costs. As
such, we consider a collection of over 166,000 COVID-19-related articles to
assess the scale and diversity of collaboration in COVID-19 research, which we
compare to non-COVID-19 controls before and during the pandemic. We show that
COVID-19 research teams are not only significantly smaller than their
non-COVID-19 counterparts, but they are also more diverse. Furthermore, we find
that COVID-19 research has increased the multidisciplinarity of authors across
most scientific fields of study, indicating that COVID-19 has helped to remove
some of the barriers that usually exist between disparate disciplines. Finally,
we highlight a number of interesting areas of multidisciplinary research during
COVID-19, and propose methodologies for visualising the nature of
multidisciplinary collaboration, which may have application beyond this
pandemic.

Titre du document Arxiv : Comprehensively identifying Long Covid articles with human-in-the-loop
  machine learning
Auteur : ['Robert Leaman', 'Rezarta Islamaj', 'Alexis Allot', 'Qingyu Chen', 'W. John Wilbur', 'Zhiyong Lu']
Texte : A significant percentage of COVID-19 survivors experience ongoing
multisystemic symptoms that often affect daily living, a condition known as
Long Covid or post-acute-sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, identifying
scientific articles relevant to Long Covid is challenging since there is no
standardized or consensus terminology. We developed an iterative
human-in-the-loop machine learning framework combining data programming with
active learning into a robust ensemble model, demonstrating higher specificity
and considerably higher sensitivity than other methods. Analysis of the Long
Covid collection shows that (1) most Long Covid articles do not refer to Long
Covid by any name (2) when the condition is named, the name used most
frequently in the literature is Long Covid, and (3) Long Covid is associated
with disorders in a wide variety of body systems. The Long Covid collection is
updated weekly and is searchable online at the LitCovid portal:

Titre du document Arxiv : Covid-19 Analysis Using Tensor Methods
Auteur : ['Dipak Dulal', 'Ramin Goudarzi Karim', 'Carmeliza Navasca']
Texte : In this paper, we use tensor models to analyze Covid-19 pandemic data. First,
we use tensor models, canonical polyadic and higher-order Tucker
decompositions, to extract patterns over multiple modes. Second, we implement a
tensor completion algorithm using canonical polyadic tensor decomposition to
predict spatiotemporal data from multiple spatial sources and to identify
Covid-19 hotspots. We apply a regularized iterative tensor completion technique
with a practical regularization parameter estimator to predict the spread of
Covid-19 cases and to find and identify hotspots. Our method can predict weekly
and quarterly Covid-19 spreads with high accuracy. Third, we analyze Covid-19
data in the US using a novel sampling method for alternating least-squares.
Moreover, we compare the algorithms with standard tensor decompositions in
terms of their interpretability, visualization and cost analysis. Finally, we
demonstrate the efficacy of the methods by applying the techniques to New
Jersey's Covid-19 data.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-19 and Influenza Joint Forecasts Using Internet Search Information
  in the United States
Auteur : ['Simin Ma', 'Shaoyang Ning', 'Shihao Yang']
Texte : As COVID-19 pandemic progresses, severe flu seasons may happen alongside an
increase in cases in cases and death of COVID-19, causing severe burdens on
health care resources and public safety. A consequence of a twindemic may be a
mixture of two different infections in the same person at the same time,
"flurona". Admist the raising trend of "flurona", forecasting both influenza
outbreaks and COVID-19 waves in a timely manner is more urgent than ever, as
accurate joint real-time tracking of the twindemic aids health organizations
and policymakers in adequate preparation and decision making. Under the current
pandemic, state-of-art influenza and COVID-19 forecasting models carry valuable
domain information but face shortcomings under current complex disease
dynamics, such as similarities in symptoms and public healthcare seeking
patterns of the two diseases. Inspired by the inner-connection between
influenza and COVID-19 activities, we propose ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble which allows
us to combine historical influenza and COVID-19 disease forecasting models to a
new ensemble framework that handles scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. Our
framework is able to emphasize learning from COVID-related or influenza
signals, through a winner-takes-all ensemble fashion. Moreover, our experiments
demonstrate that our approach is successful in adapting past influenza
forecasting models to the current pandemic, while improving upon previous
COVID-19 forecasting models, by steadily outperforming alternative benchmark
methods, and remaining competitive with publicly available models.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-19 Cough Classification using Machine Learning and Global
  Smartphone Recordings
Auteur : ['Madhurananda Pahar', 'Marisa Klopper', 'Robin Warren', 'Thomas Niesler']
Texte : We present a machine learning based COVID-19 cough classifier which can
discriminate COVID-19 positive coughs from both COVID-19 negative and healthy
coughs recorded on a smartphone. This type of screening is non-contact, easy to
apply, and can reduce the workload in testing centres as well as limit
transmission by recommending early self-isolation to those who have a cough
suggestive of COVID-19. The datasets used in this study include subjects from
all six continents and contain both forced and natural coughs, indicating that
the approach is widely applicable. The publicly available Coswara dataset
contains 92 COVID-19 positive and 1079 healthy subjects, while the second
smaller dataset was collected mostly in South Africa and contains 18 COVID-19
positive and 26 COVID-19 negative subjects who have undergone a SARS-CoV
laboratory test. Both datasets indicate that COVID-19 positive coughs are
15\%-20\% shorter than non-COVID coughs. Dataset skew was addressed by applying
the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). A leave-$p$-out
cross-validation scheme was used to train and evaluate seven machine learning
classifiers: LR, KNN, SVM, MLP, CNN, LSTM and Resnet50. Our results show that
although all classifiers were able to identify COVID-19 coughs, the best
performance was exhibited by the Resnet50 classifier, which was best able to
discriminate between the COVID-19 positive and the healthy coughs with an area
under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.98. An LSTM classifier was best able to
discriminate between the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative coughs, with
an AUC of 0.94 after selecting the best 13 features from a sequential forward
selection (SFS). Since this type of cough audio classification is
cost-effective and easy to deploy, it is potentially a useful and viable means
of non-contact COVID-19 screening.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-19 Detection and Analysis From Lung CT Images using Novel Channel
  Boosted CNNs
Auteur : ['Saddam Hussain Khan']
Texte : In December 2019, the global pandemic COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, affected
human life and the worldwide economy. Therefore, an efficient diagnostic system
is required to control its spread. However, the automatic diagnostic system
poses challenges with a limited amount of labeled data, minor contrast
variation, and high structural similarity between infection and background. In
this regard, a new two-phase deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based
diagnostic system is proposed to detect minute irregularities and analyze
COVID-19 infection. In the first phase, a novel SB-STM-BRNet CNN is developed,
incorporating a new channel Squeezed and Boosted (SB) and dilated
convolutional-based Split-Transform-Merge (STM) block to detect COVID-19
infected lung CT images. The new STM blocks performed multi-path
region-smoothing and boundary operations, which helped to learn minor contrast
variation and global COVID-19 specific patterns. Furthermore, the diverse
boosted channels are achieved using the SB and Transfer Learning concepts in
STM blocks to learn texture variation between COVID-19-specific and healthy
images. In the second phase, COVID-19 infected images are provided to the novel
COVID-CB-RESeg segmentation CNN to identify and analyze COVID-19 infectious
regions. The proposed COVID-CB-RESeg methodically employed region-homogeneity
and heterogeneity operations in each encoder-decoder block and boosted-decoder
using auxiliary channels to simultaneously learn the low illumination and
boundaries of the COVID-19 infected region. The proposed diagnostic system
yields good performance in terms of accuracy: 98.21 %, F-score: 98.24%, Dice
Similarity: 96.40 %, and IOU: 98.85 % for the COVID-19 infected region. The
proposed diagnostic system would reduce the burden and strengthen the
radiologist's decision for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.

Titre du document Arxiv : Covid-19 diagnosis from x-ray using neural networks
Auteur : ['Dinesh J', 'Mohammed Rhithick A']
Texte : Corona virus or COVID-19 is a pandemic illness, which has influenced more
than million of causalities worldwide and infected a few large number of
individuals .Innovative instrument empowering quick screening of the COVID-19
contamination with high precision can be critically useful to the medical care
experts. The primary clinical device presently being used for the analysis of
COVID-19 is the Reverse record polymerase chain response as known as RT-PCR,
which is costly, less-delicate and requires specific clinical work force. X-Ray
imaging is an effectively available apparatus that can be a great option in the
COVID-19 conclusion. This exploration was taken to examine the utility of
computerized reasoning in the quick and exact recognition of COVID-19 from
chest X-Ray pictures. The point of this paper is to propose a procedure for
programmed recognition of COVID-19 from advanced chest X-Ray images applying
pre-prepared profound learning calculations while boosting the discovery
exactness. The point is to give over-focused on clinical experts a second pair
of eyes through a learning picture characterization models. We distinguish an
appropriate Convolutional Neural Network-CNN model through beginning similar
investigation of a few mainstream CNN models.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-19 Disease Identification on Chest-CT images using CNN and VGG16
Auteur : ['Briskline Kiruba S', 'Petchiammal A', 'D. Murugan']
Texte : A newly identified coronavirus disease called COVID-19 mainly affects the
human respiratory system. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a virus
originating in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Early diagnosis is the primary
challenge of health care providers. In the earlier stage, medical organizations
were dazzled because there were no proper health aids or medicine to detect a
COVID-19. A new diagnostic tool RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction), was introduced. It collects swab specimens from the patient's nose
or throat, where the COVID-19 virus gathers. This method has some limitations
related to accuracy and testing time. Medical experts suggest an alternative
approach called CT (Computed Tomography) that can quickly diagnose the infected
lung areas and identify the COVID-19 in an earlier stage. Using chest CT
images, computer researchers developed several deep learning models identifying
the COVID-19 disease. This study presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and VGG16-based model for automated COVID-19 identification on chest CT images.
The experimental results using a public dataset of 14320 CT images showed a
classification accuracy of 96.34% and 96.99% for CNN and VGG16, respectively.

Texte : Motivation: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a new type of
coronavirus has been emerging from China and led to thousands of death globally
since December 2019. Despite many groups have engaged in studying the newly
emerged virus and searching for the treatment of COVID-19, the understanding of
the COVID-19 target-ligand interactions represents a key chal-lenge. Herein, we
introduce COVID-19 Docking Server, a web server that predicts the binding modes
between COVID-19 targets and the ligands including small molecules, peptides
and anti-bodies. Results: Structures of proteins involved in the virus life
cycle were collected or constructed based on the homologs of coronavirus, and
prepared ready for docking. The meta platform provides a free and interactive
tool for the prediction of COVID-19 target-ligand interactions and following
drug discovery for COVID-19.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-19 Hospitalizations Forecasts Using Internet Search Data
Auteur : ['Tao Wang', 'Simin Ma', 'Soobin Baek', 'Shihao Yang']
Texte : As the COVID-19 spread over the globe and new variants of COVID-19 keep
occurring, reliable real-time forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations are
critical for public health decision on medical resources allocations such as
ICU beds, ventilators, and personnel to prepare for the surge of COVID-19
pandemics. Inspired by the strong association between public search behavior
and hospitalization admission, we extended previously-proposed influenza
tracking model, ARGO (AutoRegression with GOogle search data), to predict
future 2-week national and state-level COVID-19 new hospital admissions.
Leveraging the COVID-19 related time series information and Google search data,
our method is able to robustly capture new COVID-19 variants' surges, and
self-correct at both national and state level. Based on our retrospective
out-of-sample evaluation over 12-month comparison period, our method achieves
on average 15\% error reduction over the best alternative models collected from
COVID-19 forecast hub. Overall, we showed that our method is flexible,
self-correcting, robust, accurate, and interpretable, making it a potentially
powerful tool to assist health-care officials and decision making for the
current and future infectious disease outbreak.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-19 Induced Economic Uncertainty: A Comparison between the United
  Kingdom and the United States
Auteur : ['Ugur Korkut Pata']
Texte : The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on economic policy uncertainty in the US and the UK. The impact of the
increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country, and the increase in the
number of cases and deaths outside the country may vary. To examine this, the
study employs bootstrap ARDL cointegration approach from March 8, 2020 to May
24, 2020. According to the bootstrap ARDL results, a long-run equilibrium
relationship is confirmed for five out of the 10 models. The long-term
coefficients obtained from the ARDL models suggest that an increase in COVID-19
cases and deaths outside of the UK and the US has a significant effect on
economic policy uncertainty. The US is more affected by the increase in the
number of COVID-19 cases. The UK, on the other hand, is more negatively
affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 deaths outside the country
than the increase in the number of cases. Moreover, another important finding
from the study demonstrates that COVID-19 is a factor of great uncertainty for
both countries in the short-term.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak in the Subcontinent: A data-driven analysis
Auteur : ['Bikash Chandra Singh', 'Zulfikar Alom', 'Mohammad Muntasir Rahman', 'Mrinal Kanti Baowaly', 'Mohammad Abdul Azim']
Texte : Human civilization is experiencing a critical situation that presents itself
for a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus emerged in late
December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei, China. The grim fact of COVID-19 is, it is
highly contagious in nature, therefore, spreads rapidly all over the world and
causes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Responding
to the severity of COVID-19 research community directs the attention to the
analysis of COVID-19, to diminish its antagonistic impact towards society.
Numerous studies claim that the subcontinent, i.e., Bangladesh, India, and
Pakistan, could remain in the worst affected region by the COVID-19. In order
to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict the trend of
COVID-19 beforehand the planning of effective control strategies.
Fundamentally, the idea is to dependably estimate the reproduction number to
judge the spread rate of COVID-19 in a particular region. Consequently, this
paper uses publicly available epidemiological data of Bangladesh, India, and
Pakistan to estimate the reproduction numbers. More specifically, we use
various models (for example, susceptible infection recovery (SIR), exponential
growth (EG), sequential Bayesian (SB), maximum likelihood (ML) and time
dependent (TD)) to estimate the reproduction numbers and observe the model
fitness in the corresponding data set. Experimental results show that the
reproduction numbers produced by these models are greater than 1.2
(approximately) indicates that COVID-19 is gradually spreading in the
subcontinent.

Auteur : ['Jingqi Wang', 'Noor Abu-el-rub', 'Josh Gray', 'Huy Anh Pham', 'Yujia Zhou', 'Frank Manion', 'Mei Liu', 'Xing Song', 'Hua Xu', 'Masoud Rouhizadeh', 'Yaoyun Zhang']
Texte : The COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world rapidly, infecting millions of
people. An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical
concepts of COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) will be
valuable to accelerate COVID-19 clinical research. To this end, this study aims
at adapting the existing CLAMP natural language processing tool to quickly
build COVID-19 SignSym, which can extract COVID-19 signs/symptoms and their 8
attributes (body location, severity, temporal expression, subject, condition,
uncertainty, negation, and course) from clinical text. The extracted
information is also mapped to standard concepts in the Observational Medical
Outcomes Partnership common data model. A hybrid approach of combining deep
learning-based models, curated lexicons, and pattern-based rules was applied to
quickly build the COVID-19 SignSym from CLAMP, with optimized performance. Our
extensive evaluation using 3 external sites with clinical notes of COVID-19
patients, as well as the online medical dialogues of COVID-19, shows COVID-19
Sign-Sym can achieve high performance across data sources. The workflow used
for this study can be generalized to other use cases, where existing clinical
natural language processing tools need to be customized for specific
information needs within a short time. COVID-19 SignSym is freely accessible to
the research community as a downloadable package
(https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/nlp.php) and has been used by 16 healthcare
organizations to support clinical research of COVID-19.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-19 vs Social Media Apps: Does Privacy Really Matter?
Auteur : ['Omar Haggag', 'Sherif Haggag', 'John Grundy', 'Mohamed Abdelrazek']
Texte : Many people around the world are worried about using or even downloading
COVID-19 contact tracing mobile apps. The main reported concerns are centered
around privacy and ethical issues. At the same time, people are voluntarily
using Social Media apps at a significantly higher rate during the pandemic
without similar privacy concerns compared with COVID-19 apps. To better
understand these seemingly anomalous behaviours, we analysed the privacy
policies, terms & conditions and data use agreements of the most commonly used
COVID-19, Social Media & Productivity apps. We also developed a tool to extract
and analyse nearly 2 million user reviews for these apps. Our results show that
Social Media & Productivity apps actually have substantially higher privacy and
ethical issues compared with the majority of COVID-19 apps. Surprisingly, lots
of people indicated in their user reviews that they feel more secure as their
privacy are better handled in COVID-19 apps than in Social Media apps. On the
other hand, most of the COVID-19 apps are less accessible and stable compared
to most Social Media apps, which negatively impacted their store ratings and
led users to uninstall COVID-19 apps more frequently. Our findings suggest that
in order to effectively fight this pandemic, health officials and technologists
will need to better raise awareness among people about COVID-19 app behaviour
and trustworthiness. This will allow people to better understand COVID-19 apps
and encourage them to download and use these apps. Moreover, COVID-19 apps need
many accessibility enhancements to allow a wider range of users from different
societies and cultures to access to these apps.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-19-CT-CXR: a freely accessible and weakly labeled chest X-ray and
  CT image collection on COVID-19 from biomedical literature
Auteur : ['Yifan Peng', 'Yu-Xing Tang', 'Sungwon Lee', 'Yingying Zhu', 'Ronald M. Summers', 'Zhiyong Lu']
Texte : The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there
exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans,
few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy.
At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the
biomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of
COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from
COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset.
We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in
the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed a
deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify
them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as
of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of
COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that
COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute
to improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to
distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of
diseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from
non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4)
From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms
and clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the
disease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is
complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical
image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset, code, and DL models are
publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/COVID-19-CT-CXR.

manner for diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to privacy issues, publicly
available COVID-19 CT datasets are highly difficult to obtain, which hinders
the research and development of AI-powered diagnosis methods of COVID-19 based
on CTs. To address this issue, we build an open-sourced dataset -- COVID-CT,
which contains 349 COVID-19 CT images from 216 patients and 463 non-COVID-19
CTs. The utility of this dataset is confirmed by a senior radiologist who has
been diagnosing and treating COVID-19 patients since the outbreak of this
pandemic. We also perform experimental studies which further demonstrate that
this dataset is useful for developing AI-based diagnosis models of COVID-19.
Using this dataset, we develop diagnosis methods based on multi-task learning
and self-supervised learning, that achieve an F1 of 0.90, an AUC of 0.98, and
an accuracy of 0.89. According to the senior radiologist, models with such
performance are good enough for clinical usage. The data and code are available
at https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-DA: Deep Domain Adaptation from Typical Pneumonia to COVID-19
Auteur : ['Yifan Zhang', 'Shuaicheng Niu', 'Zhen Qiu', 'Ying Wei', 'Peilin Zhao', 'Jianhua Yao', 'Junzhou Huang', 'Qingyao Wu', 'Mingkui Tan']
Texte : The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already
infected millions of people and is still rapidly spreading all over the globe.
Most COVID-19 patients suffer from lung infection, so one important diagnostic
method is to screen chest radiography images, e.g., X-Ray or CT images.
However, such examinations are time-consuming and labor-intensive, leading to
limited diagnostic efficiency. To solve this issue, AI-based technologies, such
as deep learning, have been used recently as effective computer-aided means to
improve diagnostic efficiency. However, one practical and critical difficulty
is the limited availability of annotated COVID-19 data, due to the prohibitive
annotation costs and urgent work of doctors to fight against the pandemic. This
makes the learning of deep diagnosis models very challenging. To address this,
motivated by that typical pneumonia has similar characteristics with COVID-19
and many pneumonia datasets are publicly available, we propose to conduct
domain knowledge adaptation from typical pneumonia to COVID-19. There are two
main challenges: 1) the discrepancy of data distributions between domains; 2)
the task difference between the diagnosis of typical pneumonia and COVID-19. To
address them, we propose a new deep domain adaptation method for COVID-19
diagnosis, namely COVID-DA. Specifically, we alleviate the domain discrepancy
via feature adversarial adaptation and handle the task difference issue via a
novel classifier separation scheme. In this way, COVID-DA is able to diagnose
COVID-19 effectively with only a small number of COVID-19 annotations.
Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of COVID-DA and its great
potential for real-world applications.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-FACT: A Fully-Automated Capsule Network-based Framework for
  Identification of COVID-19 Cases from Chest CT scans

Texte : The newly discovered Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been globally
spreading and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world as of
its first emergence in late 2019. Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown
distinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other diagnostic tests,
in particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms
are mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify
COVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation
and large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image
instances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend
slice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding
mechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the
disease. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fully-automated CT-based
framework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases referred to as the
"COVID-FACT". COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks
and is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. In particular, to
make the proposed COVID-FACT independent from sophisticated segmentation of the
area of infection, slices demonstrating infection are detected at the first
stage and the second stage is responsible for classifying patients into COVID
and non-COVID cases. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection, and identifies
positive COVID-19 cases using an in-house CT scan dataset, containing COVID-19,
community acquired pneumonia, and normal cases. Based on our experiments,
COVID-FACT achieves an accuracy of 90.82%, a sensitivity of 94.55%, a
specificity of 86.04%, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, while
depending on far less supervision and annotation, in comparison to its
counterparts.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-MTL: Multitask Learning with Shift3D and Random-weighted Loss for
  Automated Diagnosis and Severity Assessment of COVID-19
Auteur : ['Guoqing Bao', 'Huai Chen', 'Tongliang Liu', 'Guanzhong Gong', 'Yong Yin', 'Lisheng Wang', 'Xiuying Wang']
Texte : There is an urgent need for automated methods to assist accurate and
effective assessment of COVID-19. Radiology and nucleic acid test (NAT) are
complementary COVID-19 diagnosis methods. In this paper, we present an
end-to-end multitask learning (MTL) framework (COVID-MTL) that is capable of
automated and simultaneous detection (against both radiology and NAT) and
severity assessment of COVID-19. COVID-MTL learns different COVID-19 tasks in
parallel through our novel random-weighted loss function, which assigns
learning weights under Dirichlet distribution to prevent task dominance; our
new 3D real-time augmentation algorithm (Shift3D) introduces space variances
for 3D CNN components by shifting low-level feature representations of
volumetric inputs in three dimensions; thereby, the MTL framework is able to
accelerate convergence and improve joint learning performance compared to
single-task models. By only using chest CT scans, COVID-MTL was trained on 930
CT scans and tested on separate 399 cases. COVID-MTL achieved AUCs of 0.939 and
0.846, and accuracies of 90.23% and 79.20% for detection of COVID-19 against
radiology and NAT, respectively, which outperformed the state-of-the-art
models. Meanwhile, COVID-MTL yielded AUC of 0.800 $\pm$ 0.020 and 0.813 $\pm$
0.021 (with transfer learning) for classifying control/suspected, mild/regular,
and severe/critically-ill cases. To decipher the recognition mechanism, we also
identified high-throughput lung features that were significantly related (P <
0.001) to the positivity and severity of COVID-19.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-Net Assistant: A Deep Learning-Driven Virtual Assistant for
  COVID-19 Symptom Prediction and Recommendation
Auteur : ['Pengyuan Shi', 'Yuetong Wang', 'Saad Abbasi', 'Alexander Wong']
Texte : As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to put a significant burden on healthcare
systems worldwide, there has been growing interest in finding inexpensive
symptom pre-screening and recommendation methods to assist in efficiently using
available medical resources such as PCR tests. In this study, we introduce the
design of COVID-Net Assistant, an efficient virtual assistant designed to
provide symptom prediction and recommendations for COVID-19 by analyzing users'
cough recordings through deep convolutional neural networks. We explore a
variety of highly customized, lightweight convolutional neural network
architectures generated via machine-driven design exploration (which we refer
to as COVID-Net Assistant neural networks) on the Covid19-Cough benchmark
dataset. The Covid19-Cough dataset comprises 682 cough recordings from a
COVID-19 positive cohort and 642 from a COVID-19 negative cohort. Among the 682
cough recordings labeled positive, 382 recordings were verified by PCR test.
Our experimental results show promising, with the COVID-Net Assistant neural
networks demonstrating robust predictive performance, achieving AUC scores of
over 0.93, with the best score over 0.95 while being fast and efficient in
inference. The COVID-Net Assistant models are made available in an open source
manner through the COVID-Net open initiative and, while not a production-ready
solution, we hope their availability acts as a good resource for clinical
scientists, machine learning researchers, as well as citizen scientists to
develop innovative solutions.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-Net CT-2: Enhanced Deep Neural Networks for Detection of COVID-19
  from Chest CT Images Through Bigger, More Diverse Learning
Auteur : ['Hayden Gunraj', 'Ali Sabri', 'David Koff', 'Alexander Wong']
Texte : The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage on, with multiple waves causing
substantial harm to health and economies around the world. Motivated by the use
of CT imaging at clinical institutes around the world as an effective
complementary screening method to RT-PCR testing, we introduced COVID-Net CT, a
neural network tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images as
part of the open source COVID-Net initiative. However, one potential limiting
factor is restricted quantity and diversity given the single nation patient
cohort used. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net CT-2, enhanced deep neural
networks for COVID-19 detection from chest CT images trained on the largest
quantity and diversity of multinational patient cases in research literature.
We introduce two new CT benchmark datasets, the largest comprising a
multinational cohort of 4,501 patients from at least 15 countries. We leverage
explainability to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVID-Net CT-2,
with the results for select cases reviewed and reported on by two
board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 30 years of experience,
respectively. The COVID-Net CT-2 neural networks achieved accuracy, COVID-19
sensitivity, PPV, specificity, and NPV of 98.1%/96.2%/96.7%/99%/98.8% and
97.9%/95.7%/96.4%/98.9%/98.7%, respectively. Explainability-driven performance
validation shows that COVID-Net CT-2's decision-making behaviour is consistent
with radiologist interpretation by leveraging correct, clinically relevant
critical factors. The results are promising and suggest the strong potential of
deep neural networks as an effective tool for computer-aided COVID-19
assessment. While not a production-ready solution, we hope the open-source,
open-access release of COVID-Net CT-2 and benchmark datasets will continue to
enable researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to build upon
them.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-Net CT-S: 3D Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for
  COVID-19 Severity Assessment using Chest CT Images
Auteur : ['Hossein Aboutalebi', 'Saad Abbasi', 'Mohammad Javad Shafiee', 'Alexander Wong']
Texte : The health and socioeconomic difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic
continues to cause enormous tensions around the world. In particular, this
extraordinary surge in the number of cases has put considerable strain on
health care systems around the world. A critical step in the treatment and
management of COVID-19 positive patients is severity assessment, which is
challenging even for expert radiologists given the subtleties at different
stages of lung disease severity. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce
COVID-Net CT-S, a suite of deep convolutional neural networks for predicting
lung disease severity due to COVID-19 infection. More specifically, a 3D
residual architecture design is leveraged to learn volumetric visual indicators
characterizing the degree of COVID-19 lung disease severity. Experimental
results using the patient cohort collected by the China National Center for
Bioinformation (CNCB) showed that the proposed COVID-Net CT-S networks, by
leveraging volumetric features, can achieve significantly improved severity
assessment performance when compared to traditional severity assessment
networks that learn and leverage 2D visual features to characterize COVID-19
severity.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-Net MLSys: Designing COVID-Net for the Clinical Workflow
Auteur : ['Audrey G. Chung', 'Maya Pavlova', 'Hayden Gunraj', 'Naomi Terhljan', 'Alexander MacLean', 'Hossein Aboutalebi', 'Siddharth Surana', 'Andy Zhao', 'Saad Abbasi', 'Alexander Wong']
Texte : As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to devastate globally, one promising field
of research is machine learning-driven computer vision to streamline various
parts of the COVID-19 clinical workflow. These machine learning methods are
typically stand-alone models designed without consideration for the integration
necessary for real-world application workflows. In this study, we take a
machine learning and systems (MLSys) perspective to design a system for
COVID-19 patient screening with the clinical workflow in mind. The COVID-Net
system is comprised of the continuously evolving COVIDx dataset, COVID-Net deep
neural network for COVID-19 patient detection, and COVID-Net S deep neural
networks for disease severity scoring for COVID-19 positive patient cases. The
deep neural networks within the COVID-Net system possess state-of-the-art
performance, and are designed to be integrated within a user interface (UI) for
clinical decision support with automatic report generation to assist clinicians
in their treatment decisions.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-Net UV: An End-to-End Spatio-Temporal Deep Neural Network
  Architecture for Automated Diagnosis of COVID-19 Infection from Ultrasound
  Videos
Auteur : ['Hilda Azimi', 'Ashkan Ebadi', 'Jessy Song', 'Pengcheng Xi', 'Alexander Wong']
Texte : Besides vaccination, as an effective way to mitigate the further spread of
COVID-19, fast and accurate screening of individuals to test for the disease is
yet necessary to ensure public health safety. We propose COVID-Net UV, an
end-to-end hybrid spatio-temporal deep neural network architecture, to detect
COVID-19 infection from lung point-of-care ultrasound videos captured by convex
transducers. COVID-Net UV comprises a convolutional neural network that
extracts spatial features and a recurrent neural network that learns temporal
dependence. After careful hyperparameter tuning, the network achieves an
average accuracy of 94.44% with no false-negative cases for COVID-19 cases. The
goal with COVID-Net UV is to assist front-line clinicians in the fight against
COVID-19 via accelerating the screening of lung point-of-care ultrasound videos
and automatic detection of COVID-19 positive cases.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-Net: A Tailored Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for
  Detection of COVID-19 Cases from Chest X-Ray Images
Auteur : ['Linda Wang', 'Alexander Wong']
Texte : The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health
and well-being of the global population. A critical step in the fight against
COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key
screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography.
Motivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research
community, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural
network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray
(CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source
network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial
release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we
generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases,
with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the
best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes
predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain
deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can
aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible
and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on
relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready
solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the
description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged
and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to
accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning
solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who
need it the most.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-Rate: An Automated Framework for Segmentation of COVID-19 Lesions
  from Chest CT Scans
Auteur : ['Nastaran Enshaei', 'Anastasia Oikonomou', 'Moezedin Javad Rafiee', 'Parnian Afshar', 'Shahin Heidarian', 'Arash Mohammadi', 'Konstantinos N. Plataniotis', 'Farnoosh Naderkhani']
Texte : Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory
infection that has had devastating effects on the world. Recently, new COVID-19
variants are emerging making the situation more challenging and threatening.
Evaluation and quantification of COVID-19 lung abnormalities based on chest
Computed Tomography (CT) scans can help determining the disease stage,
efficiently allocating limited healthcare resources, and making informed
treatment decisions. During pandemic era, however, visual assessment and
quantification of COVID-19 lung lesions by expert radiologists become expensive
and prone to error, which raises an urgent quest to develop practical
autonomous solutions. In this context, first, the paper introduces an open
access COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset containing 433 CT images from 82
patients that have been annotated by an expert radiologist. Second, a Deep
Neural Network (DNN)-based framework is proposed, referred to as the
COVID-Rate, that autonomously segments lung abnormalities associated with
COVID-19 from chest CT scans. Performance of the proposed COVID-Rate framework
is evaluated through several experiments based on the introduced and external
datasets. The results show a dice score of 0:802 and specificity and
sensitivity of 0:997 and 0:832, respectively. Furthermore, the results indicate
that the COVID-Rate model can efficiently segment COVID-19 lesions in both 2D
CT images and whole lung volumes. Results on the external dataset illustrate
generalization capabilities of the COVID-Rate model to CT images obtained from
a different scanner.

Titre du document Arxiv : COVID-view: Diagnosis of COVID-19 using Chest CT
Auteur : ['Shreeraj Jadhav', 'Gaofeng Deng', 'Marlene Zawin', 'Arie E. Kaufman']
Texte : Significant work has been done towards deep learning (DL) models for
automatic lung and lesion segmentation and classification of COVID-19 on chest
CT data. However, comprehensive visualization systems focused on supporting the
dual visual+DL diagnosis of COVID-19 are non-existent. We present COVID-view, a
visualization application specially tailored for radiologists to diagnose
COVID-19 from chest CT data. The system incorporates a complete pipeline of
automatic lungs segmentation, localization/ isolation of lung abnormalities,
followed by visualization, visual and DL analysis, and
measurement/quantification tools. Our system combines the traditional 2D
workflow of radiologists with newer 2D and 3D visualization techniques with DL
support for a more comprehensive diagnosis. COVID-view incorporates a novel DL
model for classifying the patients into positive/negative COVID-19 cases, which
acts as a reading aid for the radiologist using COVID-view and provides the
attention heatmap as an explainable DL for the model output. We designed and
evaluated COVID-view through suggestions, close feedback and conducting case
studies of real-world patient data by expert radiologists who have substantial
experience diagnosing chest CT scans for COVID-19, pulmonary embolism, and
other forms of lung infections. We present requirements and task analysis for
the diagnosis of COVID-19 that motivate our design choices and results in a
practical system which is capable of handling real-world patient cases.

Titre du document Arxiv : CovidAID: COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-Ray
Auteur : ['Arpan Mangal', 'Surya Kalia', 'Harish Rajgopal', 'Krithika Rangarajan', 'Vinay Namboodiri', 'Subhashis Banerjee', 'Chetan Arora']
Texte : The exponential increase in COVID-19 patients is overwhelming healthcare
systems across the world. With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every
patient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques
(RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited sensitivity.
Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high
risk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already
available in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems
already digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples
either. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the
selection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an
inpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to
keep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in
COVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood
of COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further,
we propose the use of modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients
using X-Ray images in an automated manner, particularly in settings where
radiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing technology
scalable. We present CovidAID: COVID-19 AI Detector, a novel deep neural
network based model to triage patients for appropriate testing. On the publicly
available covid-chestxray-dataset [2], our model gives 90.5% accuracy with 100%
sensitivity (recall) for the COVID-19 infection. We significantly improve upon
the results of Covid-Net [10] on the same dataset.

Titre du document Arxiv : Deep Learning COVID-19 Features on CXR using Limited Training Data Sets
Auteur : ['Yujin Oh', 'Sangjoon Park', 'Jong Chul Ye']
Texte : Under the global pandemic of COVID-19, the use of artificial intelligence to
analyze chest X-ray (CXR) image for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage is
becoming important. Unfortunately, due to the emergent nature of the COVID-19
pandemic, a systematic collection of the CXR data set for deep neural network
training is difficult. To address this problem, here we propose a patch-based
convolutional neural network approach with a relatively small number of
trainable parameters for COVID-19 diagnosis. The proposed method is inspired by
our statistical analysis of the potential imaging biomarkers of the CXR
radiographs. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and provides clinically interpretable saliency
maps, which are useful for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage.

Titre du document Arxiv : Deep Learning Prediction of Severe Health Risks for Pediatric COVID-19
  Patients with a Large Feature Set in 2021 BARDA Data Challenge
Auteur : ['Sajid Mahmud', 'Elham Soltanikazemi', 'Frimpong Boadu', 'Ashwin Dhakal', 'Jianlin Cheng']
Texte : Most children infected with COVID-19 have no or mild symptoms and can recover
automatically by themselves, but some pediatric COVID-19 patients need to be
hospitalized or even to receive intensive medical care (e.g., invasive
mechanical ventilation or cardiovascular support) to recover from the
illnesses. Therefore, it is critical to predict the severe health risk that
COVID-19 infection poses to children to provide precise and timely medical care
for vulnerable pediatric COVID-19 patients. However, predicting the severe
health risk for COVID-19 patients including children remains a significant
challenge because many underlying medical factors affecting the risk are still
largely unknown. In this work, instead of searching for a small number of most
useful features to make prediction, we design a novel large-scale bag-of-words
like method to represent various medical conditions and measurements of
COVID-19 patients. After some simple feature filtering based on logistical
regression, the large set of features is used with a deep learning method to
predict both the hospitalization risk for COVID-19 infected children and the
severe complication risk for the hospitalized pediatric COVID-19 patients. The
method was trained and tested the datasets of the Biomedical Advanced Research
and Development Authority (BARDA) Pediatric COVID-19 Data Challenge held from
Sept. 15 to Dec. 17, 2021. The results show that the approach can rather
accurately predict the risk of hospitalization and severe complication for
pediatric COVID-19 patients and deep learning is more accurate than other
machine learning methods.

Titre du document Arxiv : Detection of Covid-19 From Chest X-ray Images Using Artificial
  Intelligence: An Early Review
Auteur : ['Muhammad Ilyas', 'Hina Rehman', 'Amine Nait-ali']
Texte : In 2019, the entire world is facing a situation of health emergency due to a
newly emerged coronavirus (COVID-19). Almost 196 countries are affected by
covid-19, while USA, Italy, China, Spain, Iran, and France have the maximum
active cases of COVID-19. The issues, medical and healthcare departments are
facing in delay of detecting the COVID-19. Several artificial intelligence
based system are designed for the automatic detection of COVID-19 using chest
x-rays. In this article we will discuss the different approaches used for the
detection of COVID-19 and the challenges we are facing. It is mandatory to
develop an automatic detection system to prevent the transfer of the virus
through contact. Several deep learning architecture are deployed for the
detection of COVID-19 such as ResNet, Inception, Googlenet etc. All these
approaches are detecting the subjects suffering with pneumonia while its hard
to decide whether the pneumonia is caused by COVID-19 or due to any other
bacterial or fungal attack.

Titre du document Arxiv : Dynamics of COVID-19 models with asymptomatic infections and quarantine
  measures
Auteur : ['Songbai Guo', 'Yuling Xue', 'Xiliang Li', 'Zuohuan Zheng']
Texte : Considering the propagation characteristics of COVID-19 in different regions,
the dynamics analysis and numerical demonstration of long-term and short-term
models of COVID-19 are carried out, respectively. The long-term model is
devoted to investigate the global stability of COVID-19 model with asymptomatic
infections and quarantine measures. By using the limit system of the model and
Lyapunov function method, it is shown that the COVID-19-free equilibrium $V^0$
is globally asymptotically stable if the control reproduction number
$\mathcal{R}_{c}<1$ and globally attractive if $\mathcal{R}_{c}=1$, which means
that COVID-19 will die out; the COVID-19 equilibrium $V^{\ast}$ is globally
asymptotically stable if $\mathcal{R}_{c}>1$, which means that COVID-19 will be
persistent. In particular, to obtain the local stability of $V^{\ast}$, we use
proof by contradiction and the properties of complex modulus with some novel
details, and we prove the weak persistence of the system to obtain the global
attractivity of $V^{\ast}$. Moreover, the final size of the corresponding
short-term model is calculated and the stability of its multiple equilibria is
analyzed. Numerical simulations of COVID-19 cases show that quarantine measures
and asymptomatic infections have a non-negligible impact on the transmission of
COVID-19.

Titre du document Arxiv : Ensemble CNN models for Covid-19 Recognition and Severity Perdition From
  3D CT-scan
Auteur : ['Fares Bougourzi', 'Cosimo Distante', 'Fadi Dornaika', 'Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed']
Texte : Since the appearance of Covid-19 in late 2019, Covid-19 has become an active
research topic for the artificial intelligence (AI) community. One of the most
interesting AI topics is Covid-19 analysis of medical imaging. CT-scan imaging
is the most informative tool about this disease. This work is part of the 2nd
COV19D competition, where two challenges are set: Covid-19 Detection and
Covid-19 Severity Detection from the CT-scans. For Covid-19 detection from
CT-scans, we proposed an ensemble of 2D Convolution blocks with Densenet-161
models. Here, each 2D convolutional block with Densenet-161 architecture is
trained separately and in testing phase, the ensemble model is based on the
average of their probabilities. On the other hand, we proposed an ensemble of
Convolutional Layers with Inception models for Covid-19 severity detection. In
addition to the Convolutional Layers, three Inception variants were used,
namely Inception-v3, Inception-v4 and Inception-Resnet. Our proposed approaches
outperformed the baseline approach in the validation data of the 2nd COV19D
competition by 11% and 16% for Covid-19 detection and Covid-19 severity
detection, respectively.

Texte : We report on cross-running the recent COVID-19 Identification ResNet (CIdeR)
on the two Interspeech 2021 COVID-19 diagnosis from cough and speech audio
challenges: ComParE and DiCOVA. CIdeR is an end-to-end deep learning neural
network originally designed to classify whether an individual is COVID-positive
or COVID-negative based on coughing and breathing audio recordings from a
published crowdsourced dataset. In the current study, we demonstrate the
potential of CIdeR at binary COVID-19 diagnosis from both the COVID-19 Cough
and Speech Sub-Challenges of INTERSPEECH 2021, ComParE and DiCOVA. CIdeR
achieves significant improvements over several baselines.

Titre du document Arxiv : Experiments of Federated Learning for COVID-19 Chest X-ray Images
Auteur : ['Boyi Liu', 'Bingjie Yan', 'Yize Zhou', 'Yifan Yang', 'Yixian Zhang']
Texte : AI plays an important role in COVID-19 identification. Computer vision and
deep learning techniques can assist in determining COVID-19 infection with
Chest X-ray Images. However, for the protection and respect of the privacy of
patients, the hospital's specific medical-related data did not allow leakage
and sharing without permission. Collecting such training data was a major
challenge. To a certain extent, this has caused a lack of sufficient data
samples when performing deep learning approaches to detect COVID-19. Federated
Learning is an available way to address this issue. It can effectively address
the issue of data silos and get a shared model without obtaining local data. In
the work, we propose the use of federated learning for COVID-19 data training
and deploy experiments to verify the effectiveness. And we also compare
performances of four popular models (MobileNet, ResNet18, MoblieNet, and
COVID-Net) with the federated learning framework and without the framework.
This work aims to inspire more researches on federated learning about COVID-19.

Titre du document Arxiv : Exploiting Shared Knowledge from Non-COVID Lesions for
  Annotation-Efficient COVID-19 CT Lung Infection Segmentation
Auteur : ['Yichi Zhang', 'Qingcheng Liao', 'Lin Yuan', 'He Zhu', 'Jiezhen Xing', 'Jicong Zhang']
Texte : The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus and has
spread all over the world, posing an extremely serious threat to all countries.
Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an
important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major
challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently,
there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing
the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19
segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven
collaborative learning model to exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions
for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung infection segmentation. The model
consists of a general encoder to capture general lung lesion features based on
multiple non-COVID lesions, and a target encoder to focus on task-specific
features based on COVID-19 infections. Features extracted from the two parallel
encoders are concatenated for the subsequent decoder part. We develop a
collaborative learning scheme to regularize feature-level relation consistency
of given input and encourage the model to learn more general and discriminative
representation of COVID-19 infections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
trained with limited COVID-19 data, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID
lesions can further improve state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.0% in
dice similarity coefficient and 4.2% in normalized surface dice. Our proposed
method promotes new insights into annotation-efficient deep learning for
COVID-19 infection segmentation and illustrates strong potential for real-world
applications in the global fight against COVID-19 in the absence of sufficient
high-quality annotations.

Titre du document Arxiv : Federated Learning for COVID-19 Detection with Generative Adversarial
  Networks in Edge Cloud Computing
Auteur : ['Dinh C. Nguyen', 'Ming Ding', 'Pubudu N. Pathirana', 'Aruna Seneviratne', 'Albert Y. Zomaya']
Texte : COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe and become a deadly pandemic.
Recently, many artificial intelligence-based approaches have been used for
COVID-19 detection, but they often require public data sharing with cloud
datacentres and thus remain privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new
federated learning scheme, called FedGAN, to generate realistic COVID-19 images
for facilitating privacy-enhanced COVID-19 detection with generative
adversarial networks (GANs) in edge cloud computing. Particularly, we first
propose a GAN where a discriminator and a generator based on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) at each edge-based medical institution alternatively are
trained to mimic the real COVID-19 data distribution. Then, we propose a new
federated learning solution which allows local GANs to collaborate and exchange
learned parameters with a cloud server, aiming to enrich the global GAN model
for generating realistic COVID-19 images without the need for sharing actual
data. To enhance the privacy in federated COVID-19 data analytics, we integrate
a differential privacy solution at each hospital institution. Moreover, we
propose a new blockchain-based FedGAN framework for secure COVID-19 data
analytics, by decentralizing the FL process with a new mining solution for low
running latency. Simulations results demonstrate the superiority of our
approach for COVID-19 detection over the state-of-the-art schemes.

Titre du document Arxiv : Finding Covid-19 from Chest X-rays using Deep Learning on a Small
  Dataset
Auteur : ['Lawrence O. Hall', 'Rahul Paul', 'Dmitry B. Goldgof', 'Gregory M. Goldgof']
Texte : Testing for COVID-19 has been unable to keep up with the demand. Further, the
false negative rate is projected to be as high as 30% and test results can take
some time to obtain. X-ray machines are widely available and provide images for
diagnosis quickly. This paper explores how useful chest X-ray images can be in
diagnosing COVID-19 disease. We have obtained 122 chest X-rays of COVID-19 and
over 4,000 chest X-rays of viral and bacterial pneumonia. A pretrained deep
convolutional neural network has been tuned on 102 COVID-19 cases and 102 other
pneumonia cases in a 10-fold cross validation. The results were all 102
COVID-19 cases were correctly classified and there were 8 false positives
resulting in an AUC of 0.997. On a test set of 20 unseen COVID-19 cases all
were correctly classified and more than 95% of 4171 other pneumonia examples
were correctly classified. This study has flaws, most critically a lack of
information about where in the disease process the COVID-19 cases were and the
small data set size. More COVID-19 case images will enable a better answer to
the question of how useful chest X-rays can be for diagnosing COVID-19 (so
please send them).

Titre du document Arxiv : FLANNEL: Focal Loss Based Neural Network Ensemble for COVID-19 Detection
Auteur : ['Zhi Qiao', 'Austin Bae', 'Lucas M. Glass', 'Cao Xiao', 'Jimeng Sun']
Texte : To test the possibility of differentiating chest x-ray images of COVID-19
against other pneumonia and healthy patients using deep neural networks. We
construct the X-ray imaging data from two publicly available sources, which
include 5508 chest x-ray images across 2874 patients with four classes: normal,
bacterial pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, and COVID-19. To identify
COVID-19, we propose a Focal Loss Based Neural Ensemble Network (FLANNEL), a
flexible module to ensemble several convolutional neural network (CNN) models
and fuse with a focal loss for accurate COVID-19 detection on class imbalance
data. FLANNEL consistently outperforms baseline models on COVID-19
identification task in all metrics. Compared with the best baseline, FLANNEL
shows a higher macro-F1 score with 6% relative increase on Covid-19
identification task where it achieves 0.7833(0.07) in Precision, 0.8609(0.03)
in Recall, and 0.8168(0.03) F1 score.

Auteur : ['Shuting Jin', 'Xiangxiang Zeng', 'Wei Huang', 'Feng Xia', 'Changzhi Jiang', 'Xiangrong Liu', 'Shaoliang Peng']
Texte : The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) belongs to human coronaviruses
(HCoVs), which spreads rapidly around the world. Compared with new drug
development, drug repurposing may be the best shortcut for treating COVID-19.
Therefore, we constructed a comprehensive heterogeneous network based on the
HCoVs-related target proteins and use the previously proposed deepDTnet, to
discover potential drug candidates for COVID-19. We obtain high performance in
predicting the possible drugs effective for COVID-19 related proteins. In
summary, this work utilizes a powerful heterogeneous network-based deep
learning method, which may be beneficial to quickly identify candidate
repurposable drugs toward future clinical trials for COVID-19. The code and
data are available at https://github.com/stjin-XMU/HnDR-COVID.

Titre du document Arxiv : Identifying Radiological Findings Related to COVID-19 from Medical
  Literature
Auteur : ['Yuxiao Liang', 'Pengtao Xie']
Texte : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than one million
individuals all over the world and caused more than 55,000 deaths, as of April
3 in 2020. Radiological findings are important sources of information in
guiding the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. However, the existing studies
on how radiological findings are correlated with COVID-19 are conducted
separately by different hospitals, which may be inconsistent or even
conflicting due to population bias. To address this problem, we develop natural
language processing methods to analyze a large collection of COVID-19
literature containing study reports from hospitals all over the world,
reconcile these results, and draw unbiased and universally-sensible conclusions
about the correlation between radiological findings and COVID-19. We apply our
method to the CORD-19 dataset and successfully extract a set of radiological
findings that are closely tied to COVID-19.

Titre du document Arxiv : Impact of COVID-19 on Astronomy: Two Years In
Auteur : ['Vanessa Böhm', 'Jia Liu']
Texte : We study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on astronomy using public
records of astronomical publications. We show that COVID-19 has had both
positive and negative impacts on research in astronomy. We find that the
overall output of the field, measured by the yearly paper count, has increased.
This is mainly driven by boosted individual productivity seen across most
countries, possibly the result of cultural and technological changes in the
scientific community during COVID. However, a decreasing number of incoming new
researchers is seen in most of the countries we studied, indicating larger
barriers for new researchers to enter the field or for junior researchers to
complete their first project during COVID. Unfortunately, the overall
improvement in productivity seen in the field is not equally shared by female
astronomers. By fraction, fewer papers are written by women and fewer women are
among incoming new researchers in most countries. Even though female
astronomers also became more productive during COVID, the level of improvement
is smaller than for men. Pre-COVID, female astronomers in the Netherlands,
Australia, Switzerland were equally as or even more productive than their male
colleagues. During COVID, no single country's female astronomers were able to
be more productive than their male colleagues on average.

Titre du document Arxiv : Impact of COVID-19 on Mobility and Electric Vehicle Charging Load
Auteur : ['Alejandro Palomino', 'Masood Parvania', 'Regan Zane']
Texte : The COVID-19 pandemic has depressed overall mobility across the country. The
changes seen reflect responses to new COVID-19 cases, local health guidelines,
and seasonality, making the relationship between mobility and COVID-19 unique
from region to region. This paper presents a data-driven case study of electric
vehicle (EV) charging and mobility in the wake of COVID-19. The study shows
that the number of EV charging sessions and total energy consumed per day
dropped by 40% immediately after the arrival of the first COVID-19 case in
Utah. By contrast, the energy consumed per charging session fell by just 8%
over the same periods and the distribution of session start and end times
remained consistent throughout the year. While EV mobility dropped more
dramatically than total vehicle mobility during the first wave of COVID-19
cases, and returned more slowly, both returned to stable levels near their mean
values by September 2020, despite a dramatic third wave in new infections.

Titre du document Arxiv : Improving Load Forecast in Energy Markets During COVID-19
Auteur : ['Ziyun Wang', 'Hao Wang']
Texte : The abrupt outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was the most significant event
in 2020, which had profound and lasting impacts across the world. Studies on
energy markets observed a decline in energy demand and changes in energy
consumption behaviors during COVID-19. However, as an essential part of system
operation, how the load forecasting performs amid COVID-19 is not well
understood. This paper aims to bridge the research gap by systematically
evaluating models and features that can be used to improve the load forecasting
performance amid COVID-19. Using real-world data from the New York Independent
System Operator, our analysis employs three deep learning models and adopts
both novel COVID-related features as well as classical weather-related
features. We also propose simulating the stay-at-home situation with
pre-stay-at-home weekend data and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving
load forecasting accuracy during COVID-19.

Titre du document Arxiv : Innovation in times of Covid-19
Auteur : ['Torsten Heinrich', 'Jangho Yang']
Texte : Did the Covid-19 pandemic have an impact on innovation? Past economic
disruptions, anecdotal evidence, and the previous literature suggest a decline
with substantial differences between industries. We leverage USPTO patent
application data to investigate and quantify the disturbance. We assess
differences by field of technology (at the CPC subclass level) as well as the
impact of direct and indirect relevance for the management of the pandemic.
Direct Covid-19 relevance is identified from a keyword search of the patent
application fulltexts; indirect Covid-19 relevance is derived from past CPC
subclass to subclass citation patterns. We find that direct Covid-19 relevance
is associated with a strong boost to the growth of the number of patent
applications in the first year of the pandemic at the same order of magnitude
(in percentage points) as the percentage of patents referencing Covid-19. We
find no effect for indirect Covid-19 relevance, indicating a focus on applied
research at the expense of more basic research. Fields of technology (CPC
mainsections) have an additional significant impact, with, e.g., mainsections A
(human necessities) and C (chemistry, metallurgy) having a strong performance.

Titre du document Arxiv : Machine Learning Automatically Detects COVID-19 using Chest CTs in a
  Large Multicenter Cohort

Sauter', 'Youngjin Yoo', 'Valentin Ziebandt', 'Dorin Comaniciu']
Texte : Objectives: To investigate machine-learning classifiers and interpretable
models using chest CT for detection of COVID-19 and differentiation from other
pneumonias, ILD and normal CTs.
  Methods: Our retrospective multi-institutional study obtained 2096 chest CTs
from 16 institutions (including 1077 COVID-19 patients). Training/testing
cohorts included 927/100 COVID-19, 388/33 ILD, 189/33 other pneumonias, and
559/34 normal (no pathologies) CTs. A metric-based approach for classification
of COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and
random forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 via 3D
features extracted directly from CT attenuation and probability distribution of
airspace opacities.
  Results: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are percentage of airspace
opacity and peripheral and basal predominant opacities, concordant with the
typical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering compares feature distribution across COVID-19 and
control cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC=0.83,
sensitivity=0.74, and specificity=0.79 of versus respectively 0.93, 0.90, and
0.83 for the DL-based classifier. Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19
pneumonia with manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as mild
COVID-19 cases. Non-COVID-19 classification performance is 91% for ILD, 64% for
other pneumonias and 94% for no pathologies, which demonstrates the robustness
of our method against different compositions of control groups.
  Conclusions: Our new method accurately discriminates COVID-19 from other
types of pneumonia, ILD, and no pathologies CTs, using quantitative imaging
features derived from chest CT, while balancing interpretability of results and
classification performance, and therefore may be useful to facilitate diagnosis
of COVID-19.

Titre du document Arxiv : Meta-research on COVID-19: An overview of the early trends
Auteur : ['Giovanni Colavizza']
Texte : COVID-19 is having a dramatic impact on research and researchers. The
pandemic has underlined the severity of known challenges in research and
surfaced new ones, but also accelerated the adoption of innovations and
manifested new opportunities. This review considers early trends emerging from
meta-research on COVID-19. In particular, it focuses on the following topics:
i) mapping COVID-19 research; ii) data and machine learning; iii) research
practices including open access and open data, reviewing, publishing and
funding; iv) communicating research to the public; v) the impact of COVID-19 on
researchers, in particular with respect to gender and career trajectories. This
overview finds that most early meta-research on COVID-19 has been reactive and
focused on short-term questions, while more recently a shift to consider the
long-term consequences of COVID-19 is taking place. Based on these findings,
the author speculates that some aspects of doing research during COVID-19 are
more likely to persist than others. These include: the shift to virtual for
academic events such as conferences; the use of openly accessible pre-prints;
the `datafication' of scholarly literature and consequent broader adoption of
machine learning in science communication; the public visibility of research

Titre du document Arxiv : Mining the Relationship Between COVID-19 Sentiment and Market
  Performance
Auteur : ['Ziyuan Xia', 'Jeffery Chen']
Texte : At the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in March, we observed one of the
largest stock market crashes in history. Within the months following this, a
volatile bullish climb back to pre-pandemic performances and higher. In this
paper, we study the stock market behavior during the initial few months of the
COVID-19 pandemic in relation to COVID-19 sentiment. Using text sentiment
analysis of Twitter data, we look at tweets that contain key words in relation
to the COVID-19 pandemic and the sentiment of the tweet to understand whether
sentiment can be used as an indicator for stock market performance. There has
been previous research done on applying natural language processing and text
sentiment analysis to understand the stock market performance, given how
prevalent the impact of COVID-19 is to the economy, we want to further the
application of these techniques to understand the relationship that COVID-19
has with stock market performance. Our findings show that there is a strong
relationship to COVID-19 sentiment derived from tweets that could be used to
predict stock market performance in the future.

Titre du document Arxiv : MiniSeg: An Extremely Minimum Network for Efficient COVID-19
  Segmentation
Auteur : ['Yu Qiu', 'Yun Liu', 'Shijie Li', 'Jing Xu']
Texte : The rapid spread of the new pandemic, i.e., COVID-19, has severely threatened
global health. Deep-learning-based computer-aided screening, e.g., COVID-19
infected CT area segmentation, has attracted much attention. However, the
publicly available COVID-19 training data are limited, easily causing
overfitting for traditional deep learning methods that are usually data-hungry
with millions of parameters. On the other hand, fast training/testing and low
computational cost are also necessary for quick deployment and development of
COVID-19 screening systems, but traditional deep learning methods are usually
computationally intensive. To address the above problems, we propose MiniSeg, a
lightweight deep learning model for efficient COVID-19 segmentation. Compared
with traditional segmentation methods, MiniSeg has several significant
strengths: i) it only has 83K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii)
it has high computational efficiency and is thus convenient for practical
deployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their private
COVID-19 data for further improving performance. In addition, we build a
comprehensive COVID-19 segmentation benchmark for comparing MiniSeg to
traditional methods.

Titre du document Arxiv : MM-COVID: A Multilingual and Multimodal Data Repository for Combating
  COVID-19 Disinformation
Auteur : ['Yichuan Li', 'Bohan Jiang', 'Kai Shu', 'Huan Liu']
Texte : The COVID-19 epidemic is considered as the global health crisis of the whole
society and the greatest challenge mankind faced since World War Two.
Unfortunately, the fake news about COVID-19 is spreading as fast as the virus
itself. The incorrect health measurements, anxiety, and hate speeches will have
bad consequences on people's physical health, as well as their mental health in
the whole world. To help better combat the COVID-19 fake news, we propose a new
fake news detection dataset MM-COVID(Multilingual and Multidimensional COVID-19
Fake News Data Repository). This dataset provides the multilingual fake news
and the relevant social context. We collect 3981 pieces of fake news content
and 7192 trustworthy information from English, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi,
French and Italian, 6 different languages. We present a detailed and
exploratory analysis of MM-COVID from different perspectives and demonstrate
the utility of MM-COVID in several potential applications of COVID-19 fake news
study on multilingual and social media.

Titre du document Arxiv : Modeling Macroeconomic Variations After COVID-19
Auteur : ['Serena Ng']
Texte : The coronavirus is a global event of historical proportions and just a few
months changed the time series properties of the data in ways that make many
pre-covid forecasting models inadequate. It also creates a new problem for
estimation of economic factors and dynamic causal effects because the
variations around the outbreak can be interpreted as outliers, as shifts to the
distribution of existing shocks, or as addition of new shocks. I take the
latter view and use covid indicators as controls to 'de-covid' the data prior
to estimation. I find that economic uncertainty remains high at the end of 2020
even though real economic activity has recovered and covid uncertainty has
receded. Dynamic responses of variables to shocks in a VAR similar in magnitude
and shape to the ones identified before 2020 can be recovered by directly or
indirectly modeling covid and treating it as exogenous. These responses to
economic shocks are distinctly different from those to a covid shock which are
much larger but shorter lived. Disentangling the two types of shocks can be
important in macroeconomic modeling post-covid.

Titre du document Arxiv : Modeling time evolving COVID-19 uncertainties with density dependent
  asymptomatic infections and social reinforcement
Auteur : ['Qing Liu', 'Longbing Cao']
Texte : The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges in modeling its
complex epidemic transmissions, infection and contagion, which are very
different from known epidemics. The challenges in quantifying COVID-19
complexities include effectively modeling its process and data uncertainties.
The uncertainties are embedded in implicit and high-proportional undocumented
infections, asymptomatic contagion, social reinforcement of infections, and
various quality issues in the reported data. These uncertainties become even
more apparent in the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the
relevant knowledge, case reporting and testing were all limited. Here we
introduce a novel hybrid approach Susceptible-Undocumented infected-Documented
infected-Recovered (SUDR) model. First, SUDR (1) characterizes and
distinguishes Undocumented (U) and Documented (D) infections commonly seen
during COVID-19 incubation periods and asymptomatic infections. Second, SUDR
characterizes the probabilistic density of infections by capturing exogenous
processes. Lastly, SUDR approximates the density likelihood of COVID-19
prevalence over time by incorporating Bayesian inference into SUDR. Different
from existing COVID-19 models, SUDR characterizes the undocumented infections
during unknown transmission processes. To capture the uncertainties of temporal
transmission and social reinforcement during COVID-19 contagion, the
transmission rate is modeled by a time-varying density function of undocumented
infectious cases. By sampling from the mean-field posterior distribution with
reasonable priors, SUDR handles the randomness, noise and sparsity of COVID-19
observations widely seen in the public COVID-19 case data. The results
demonstrate a deeper quantitative understanding of the above uncertainties, in
comparison with classic SIR, time-dependent SIR, and probabilistic SIR models.

Titre du document Arxiv : NAIST COVID: Multilingual COVID-19 Twitter and Weibo Dataset
Auteur : ['Zhiwei Gao', 'Shuntaro Yada', 'Shoko Wakamiya', 'Eiji Aramaki']
Texte : Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the late 2019,
it has affected over 200 countries and billions of people worldwide. This has
affected the social life of people owing to enforcements, such as "social
distancing" and "stay at home." This has resulted in an increasing interaction
through social media. Given that social media can bring us valuable information
about COVID-19 at a global scale, it is important to share the data and
encourage social media studies against COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.
Therefore, we have released a multilingual dataset of social media posts
related to COVID-19, consisting of microblogs in English and Japanese from
Twitter and those in Chinese from Weibo. The data cover microblogs from January
20, 2020, to March 24, 2020. This paper also provides a quantitative as well as
qualitative analysis of these datasets by creating daily word clouds as an
example of text-mining analysis. The dataset is now available on Github. This
dataset can be analyzed in a multitude of ways and is expected to help in
efficient communication of precautions related to COVID-19.

Titre du document Arxiv : On the intrinsic dimensionality of Covid-19 data: a global perspective
Auteur : ['Abhishek Varghese', 'Edgar Santos-Fernandez', 'Francesco Denti', 'Antonietta Mira', 'Kerrie Mengersen']
Texte : This paper aims to develop a global perspective of the complexity of the
relationship between the standardised per-capita growth rate of Covid-19 cases,
deaths, and the OxCGRT Covid-19 Stringency Index, a measure describing a
country's stringency of lockdown policies. To achieve our goal, we use a
heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimator implemented as a Bayesian mixture
model, called Hidalgo. We identify that the Covid-19 dataset may project onto
two low-dimensional manifolds without significant information loss. The low
dimensionality suggests strong dependency among the standardised growth rates
of cases and deaths per capita and the OxCGRT Covid-19 Stringency Index for a
country over 2020-2021. Given the low dimensional structure, it may be feasible
to model observable Covid-19 dynamics with few parameters. Importantly, we
identify spatial autocorrelation in the intrinsic dimension distribution
worldwide. Moreover, we highlight that high-income countries are more likely to
lie on low-dimensional manifolds, likely arising from aging populations,
comorbidities, and increased per capita mortality burden from Covid-19.
Finally, we temporally stratify the dataset to examine the intrinsic dimension
at a more granular level throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.

Titre du document Arxiv : Pandemic Pressures and Public Health Care: Evidence from England
Auteur : ['Thiemo Fetzer', 'Christopher Rauh']
Texte : This paper documents that the COVID-19 pandemic induced pressures on the
health care system have significant adverse knock-on effects on the
accessibility and quality of non-COVID-19 care. We observe persistently
worsened performance and longer waiting times in A&E; drastically limited
access to specialist care; notably delayed or inaccessible diagnostic services;
acutely undermined access to and quality of cancer care. We find that providers
under COVID-19 pressures experience notably more excess deaths among non-COVID
related hospital episodes such as, for example, for treatment of heart attacks.
We estimate there to be at least one such non-COVID-19 related excess death
among patients being admitted to hospital for non-COVID-19 reasons for every 30
COVID-19 deaths that is caused by the disruption to the quality of care due to
COVID-19. In total, this amounts to 4,003 non COVID-19 excess deaths from March
2020 to February 2021. Further, there are at least 32,189 missing cancer
patients that should counterfactually have started receiving treatment which
suggests continued increased numbers of excess deaths in the future due to
delayed access to care in the past.

Titre du document Arxiv : Pay Attention to the cough: Early Diagnosis of COVID-19 using
  Interpretable Symptoms Embeddings with Cough Sound Signal Processing
Auteur : ['Ankit Pal', 'Malaikannan Sankarasubbu']
Texte : COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to
a treacherous and devastating catastrophe for humanity. At the time of writing,
no specific antivirus drugs or vaccines are recommended to control infection
transmission and spread. The current diagnosis of COVID-19 is done by
Reverse-Transcription Polymer Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. However, this
method is expensive, time-consuming, and not easily available in straitened
regions. An interpretable and COVID-19 diagnosis AI framework is devised and
developed based on the cough sounds features and symptoms metadata to overcome
these limitations. The proposed framework's performance was evaluated using a
medical dataset containing Symptoms and Demographic data of 30000 audio
segments, 328 cough sounds from 150 patients with four cough classes (
COVID-19, Asthma, Bronchitis, and Healthy). Experiments' results show that the
model captures the better and robust feature embedding to distinguish between
COVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs with higher
specificity and accuracy of 95.04 $\pm$ 0.18% and 96.83$\pm$ 0.18%
respectively, all the while maintaining interpretability.

Titre du document Arxiv : Predicting the spread of COVID-19 in Delhi, India using Deep Residual
  Recurrent Neural Networks
Auteur : ['Shashank Reddy Vadyala', 'Sai Nethra Betgeri']
Texte : Detecting the spread of coronavirus will go a long way toward reducing human
and economic loss. Unfortunately, existing Epidemiological models used for
COVID 19 prediction models are too slow and fail to capture the COVID-19
development in detail. This research uses Partial Differential Equations to
improve the processing speed and accuracy of forecasting of COVID 19 governed
by SEIRD model equations. The dynamics of COVID 19 were extracted using
Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Residual Recurrent Neural Networks from
data simulated using PDEs. The DRRNNs accuracy is measured using Mean Squared
Error. The DRRNNs COVID-19 prediction model has been shown to have accurate
COVID-19 predictions. In addition, we concluded that DR-RNNs can significantly
advance the ability to support decision-making in real time COVID-19
prediction.

Titre du document Arxiv : Prediction of repurposed drugs for treating lung injury in COVID-19
Auteur : ['Bing He', 'Lana Garmire']
Texte : Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease discovered in 2019
and currently in outbreak across the world. Lung injury with severe respiratory
failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, brought by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks
efficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory
failure. Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in
COVID-19. We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified
tetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating
lung injuries in COVID-19, based on their abilities to reverse the gene
expression patterns in HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and in human
COVID-19 patient lung tissues. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that
twelve significantly enriched pathways (P-value <0.05) overlap between HCC515
cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues,
including signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as
TNF signaling, MAPK signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways. All these
twelve pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such
as RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares eleven of
twelve pathways with COL-3 with common target genes such as RHOA. It also
uniquely targets genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. In
summary, this study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms
leading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and
CGP-60474 have the potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.

Titre du document Arxiv : Quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on the US stock market: An analysis
  from multi-source information
Auteur : ['Asim Kumer Dey', 'Toufiqul Haq', 'Kumer Das', 'Irina Panovska']
Texte : We develop a novel temporal complex network approach to quantify the US
county level spread dynamics of COVID-19. The objective is to study the effects
of the local spread dynamics, COVID-19 cases and death, and Google search
activities on the US stock market. We use both conventional econometric and
Machine Learning (ML) models. The results suggest that COVID-19 cases and
deaths, its local spread, and Google searches have impacts on abnormal stock
prices between January 2020 to May 2020. In addition, incorporating information
about local spread significantly improves the performance of forecasting models
of the abnormal stock prices at longer forecasting horizons. On the other hand,
although a few COVID-19 related variables, e.g., US total deaths and US new
cases exhibit causal relationships on price volatility, COVID-19 cases and
deaths, local spread of COVID-19, and Google search activities do not have
impacts on price volatility.

Titre du document Arxiv : QUCoughScope: An Artificially Intelligent Mobile Application to Detect
  Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients using Cough and Breathing Sounds

Texte : In the break of COVID-19 pandemic, mass testing has become essential to
reduce the spread of the virus. Several recent studies suggest that a
significant number of COVID-19 patients display no physical symptoms
whatsoever. Therefore, it is unlikely that these patients will undergo COVID-19
test, which increases their chances of unintentionally spreading the virus.
Currently, the primary diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 is RT-PCR test on
collected respiratory specimens from the suspected case. This requires patients
to travel to a laboratory facility to be tested, thereby potentially infecting
others along the way.It is evident from recent researches that asymptomatic
COVID-19 patients cough and breath in a different way than the healthy people.
Several research groups have created mobile and web-platform for crowdsourcing
the symptoms, cough and breathing sounds from healthy, COVID-19 and Non-COVID
patients. Some of these data repositories were made public. We have received
such a repository from Cambridge University team under data-sharing agreement,
where we have cough and breathing sound samples for 582 and 141 healthy and
COVID-19 patients, respectively. 87 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, while
rest of them have cough. We have developed an Android application to
automatically screen COVID-19 from the comfort of people homes. Test subjects
can simply download a mobile application, enter their symptoms, record an audio
clip of their cough and breath, and upload the data anonymously to our servers.
Our backend server converts the audio clip to spectrogram and then apply our
state-of-the-art machine learning model to classify between cough sounds
produced by COVID-19 patients, as opposed to healthy subjects or those with
other respiratory conditions. The system can detect asymptomatic COVID-19
patients with a sensitivity more than 91%.

Titre du document Arxiv : Reliable COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-ray Images
Auteur : ['Aysen Degerli', 'Mete Ahishali', 'Serkan Kiranyaz', 'Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury', 'Moncef Gabbouj']
Texte : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged the need for computer-aided
diagnosis with automatic, accurate, and fast algorithms. Recent studies have
applied Machine Learning algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis over chest X-ray
(CXR) images. However, the data scarcity in these studies prevents a reliable
evaluation with the potential of overfitting and limits the performance of deep
networks. Moreover, these networks can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia usually
from healthy subjects only or occasionally, from limited pneumonia types. Thus,
there is a need for a robust and accurate COVID-19 detector evaluated over a
large CXR dataset. To address this need, in this study, we propose a reliable
COVID-19 detection network: ReCovNet, which can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia
from 14 different thoracic diseases and healthy subjects. To accomplish this,
we have compiled the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 124,616
images including 4603 COVID-19 samples. The proposed ReCovNet achieved a
detection performance with 98.57% sensitivity and 99.77% specificity.

Titre du document Arxiv : Residual Attention U-Net for Automated Multi-Class Segmentation of
  COVID-19 Chest CT Images
Auteur : ['Xiaocong Chen', 'Lina Yao', 'Yu Zhang']
Texte : The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly
around the world and caused significant impact on the public health and
economy. However, there is still lack of studies on effectively quantifying the
lung infection caused by COVID-19. As a basic but challenging task of the
diagnostic framework, segmentation plays a crucial role in accurate
quantification of COVID-19 infection measured by computed tomography (CT)
images. To this end, we proposed a novel deep learning algorithm for automated
segmentation of multiple COVID-19 infection regions. Specifically, we use the
Aggregated Residual Transformations to learn a robust and expressive feature
representation and apply the soft attention mechanism to improve the capability
of the model to distinguish a variety of symptoms of the COVID-19. With a
public CT image dataset, we validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in
comparison with other competing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our algorithm for automated segmentation of COVID-19
Chest CT images. Our study provides a promising deep leaning-based segmentation
tool to lay a foundation to quantitative diagnosis of COVID-19 lung infection
in CT images.

Titre du document Arxiv : Smoking prevalence in Covid-19 patients
Auteur : ['Sina Bagheri-Nezhad', 'Nasser Mozayani', 'Elham Abdi', 'Setareh Rostami']
Texte : We investigate the prevalence rate of smoking in Covid-19 patients and
examine whether there is a difference in the distribution of smokers between
the two statistical populations of critically ill patients with Covid-19 and
the entire Iranian population or not. To do this, we first prepared a sample of
1040 Covid-19 patients admitted to hospitals in Tehran, Rasht, and Bojnord.
Then, through the non-parametric statistical runs test, we show that the sample
was randomly selected, and it is possible to generalize the result of tests on
the sample to the community of hospitalized Covid-19 patients. In continuation,
we examined the hypothesis that the smoking prevalence among Covid-19 patients
admitted to hospitals is equal to the prevalence rate of smoking in Iranian
society. For this purpose, we used the non-parametric chi-square test, and it
was observed that this hypothesis is rejected. The data show a significant
difference in the prevalence of smoking between critically ill Covid-19
patients and the whole of Iranian society. Additionally, we examined this
hypothesis in some subpopulations, and the results were the same.

Titre du document Arxiv : Studying the Similarity of COVID-19 Sounds based on Correlation Analysis
  of MFCC
Auteur : ['Mohamed Bader', 'Ismail Shahin', 'Abdelfatah Hassan']
Texte : Recently there has been a formidable work which has been put up from the
people who are working in the frontlines such as hospitals, clinics, and labs
alongside researchers and scientists who are also putting tremendous efforts in
the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the preposterous spread of the
virus, the integration of the artificial intelligence has taken a considerable
part in the health sector, by implementing the fundamentals of Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we illustrate
the importance of speech signal processing in the extraction of the
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) of the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
samples and find their relationship using Pearson correlation coefficients. Our
results show high similarity in MFCCs between different COVID-19 cough and
breathing sounds, while MFCC of voice is more robust between COVID-19 and
non-COVID-19 samples. Moreover, our results are preliminary, and there is a
possibility to exclude the voices of COVID-19 patients from further processing
in diagnosing the disease.

Titre du document Arxiv : Synthesis of COVID-19 Chest X-rays using Unpaired Image-to-Image
  Translation
Auteur : ['Hasib Zunair', 'A. Ben Hamza']
Texte : Motivated by the lack of publicly available datasets of chest radiographs of
positive patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we build the
first-of-its-kind open dataset of synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray images of high
fidelity using an unsupervised domain adaptation approach by leveraging class
conditioning and adversarial training. Our contributions are twofold. First, we
show considerable performance improvements on COVID-19 detection using various
deep learning architectures when employing synthetic images as additional
training set. Second, we show how our image synthesis method can serve as a
data anonymization tool by achieving comparable detection performance when
trained only on synthetic data. In addition, the proposed data generation
framework offers a viable solution to the COVID-19 detection in particular, and
to medical image classification tasks in general. Our publicly available
benchmark dataset consists of 21,295 synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray images. The
insights gleaned from this dataset can be used for preventive actions in the
fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Titre du document Arxiv : The effect of the rapid growth of covid-19 publications on citation
  indicators
Auteur : ['Peter Sjögårde']
Texte : A concern has been raised that "covidization" of research would cause an
overemphasizes on covid-19 and pandemics at the expense of other research. The
rapid growth of publications related to the Covid-19 pandemic renders a vast
amount of citations from this literature. This growth may affect bibliometric
indicators. In this paper I explored how the growth of covid-19 publications
influences bibliometric indicators commonly used in university rankings,
research evaluation and research allocation, namely the field normalized
citation score and the journal impact factor. I found that the burst of
publications in the early stage of the covid-19 pandemic affects
field-normalized citation scores and will affect the journal impact factor.
Publications unrelated to covid-19 are also heavily affected. I conclude that
there is a considerable risk to draw misleading conclusions from citation
indicators spanning over the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, in particular
when time series are used and when the biomedical literature is assessed.

Titre du document Arxiv : The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Scientific Research in the Life
  Sciences
Auteur : ['Massimo Riccaboni', 'Luca Verginer']
Texte : The COVID-19 outbreak has posed an unprecedented challenge to humanity and
science. On the one side, public and private incentives have been put in place
to promptly allocate resources toward research areas strictly related to the
COVID-19 emergency. But on the flip side, research in many fields not directly
related to the pandemic has lagged behind. In this paper, we assess the impact
of COVID-19 on world scientific production in the life sciences. We investigate
how the usage of medical subject headings (MeSH) has changed following the
outbreak. We estimate through a difference-in-differences approach the impact
of COVID-19 on scientific production through PubMed. We find that COVID-related
research topics have risen to prominence, displaced clinical publications,
diverted funds away from research areas not directly related to COVID-19 and
that the number of publications on clinical trials in unrelated fields has
contracted. Our results call for urgent targeted policy interventions to
reactivate biomedical research in areas that have been neglected by the
COVID-19 emergency.

Titre du document Arxiv : The Morbid Realities of Social Media: An Investigation into the
  Misinformation Shared by the Deceased Victims of COVID-19
Auteur : ['Hussam Habib', 'Rishab Nithyanand']
Texte : Social media platforms have had considerable impact on the real world
especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Misinformation related to Covid-19
might have caused significant impact on the population specifically due to its
association with dangerous beliefs such as anti-vaccination and Covid denial.
In this work, we study a unique dataset of Facebook posts by users who shared
and believed in Covid-19 misinformation before succumbing to Covid-19 often
resulting in death. We aim to characterize the dominant themes and sources
present in the victim's posts along with identifying the role of the platform
in handling deadly narratives. Our analysis reveals the overwhelming
politicization of Covid-19 through the prevalence of anti-government themes
propagated by right-wing political and media ecosystem. Furthermore, we
highlight the failures of Facebook's implementation and completeness of soft
moderation actions intended to warn users of misinformation. Results from this
study bring insights into the responsibility of political elites in shaping
public discourse and the platform's role in dampening the reach of harmful
misinformation.

Titre du document Arxiv : Towards a GDPR-Compliant Blockchain-Based COVID Vaccination Passport
Auteur : ['AKM Bahalul Haque', 'Bilal Naqvi', 'A. K. M. Najmul Islam', 'Sami Hyrynsalmi']
Texte : The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world and limited work/personal life
activities. Besides the loss of human lives and agony faced by humankind, the
pandemic has badly hit different sectors economically, including the travel
industry. Special arrangements, including COVID test before departure and on
arrival, and voluntary quarantine, were enforced to limit the risk of
transmission. However, the hope for returning to a normal (pre-COVID) routine
relies on the success of the current COVID vaccination drives administered by
different countries. To open for tourism and other necessary travel, a need is
realized for a universally accessible proof of COVID vaccination, allowing
travelers to cross the borders without any hindrance. This paper presents an
architectural framework for a GDPR-compliant blockchain-based COVID vaccination
passport (VacciFi), whilst considering the relevant developments, especially in
the European Union region.

Titre du document Arxiv : Tracking the Twitter attention around the research efforts on the
  COVID-19 pandemic
Auteur : ['Zhichao Fang', 'Rodrigo Costas']
Texte : The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a bulk of
scientific research and related Twitter discussions. To unravel the public
concerns about the COVID-19 crisis reflected in the science-based Twitter
conversations, this study tracked the Twitter attention around the COVID-19
research efforts during the first three months of 2020. On the basis of nearly
1.4 million Twitter mentions of 6,162 COVID-19-related scientific publications,
we investigated the temporal tweeting dynamic and the Twitter users involved in
the online discussions around COVID-19-related research. The results show that
the quantity of Twitter mentions of COVID-19-related publications was on
rising. Scholarly-oriented Twitter users played an influential role in
disseminating research outputs on COVID-19, with their tweets being frequently
retweeted. Over time, a change in the focus of the Twitter discussions can be
observed, from the initial attention to virological and clinical research to
more practical topics, such as the potential treatments, the countermeasures by
the governments, the healthcare measures, and the influences on the economy and
society, in more recent times.

Titre du document Arxiv : Understanding Complex Patterns in Social, Geographic, and Economic
  Inequities in COVID-19 Mortality at the County Level in the US Using
  Generalized Additive Models
Auteur : ['Christian Testa']
Texte : I present three types of applications of generalized additive models (GAMs)
to COVID-19 mortality rates in the US for the purpose of advancing methods to
document inequities with respect to which communities suffered disproportionate
COVID-19 mortality rates at specific times during the first three years of the
pandemic. First, GAMs can be used to describe the changing relationship between
COVID-19 mortality and county-level covariates (sociodemographic, economic, and
political metrics) over time. Second, GAMs can be used to perform
spatiotemporal smoothing that pools information over time and space to address
statistical instability due to small population counts or stochasticity
resulting in a smooth, dynamic latent risk surface summarizing the mortality
risk associated with geographic locations over time. Third, estimation of
COVID-19 mortality associations with county-level covariates conditional on a
smooth spatiotemporal risk surface allows for more rigorous consideration of
how socio-environmental contexts and policies may have impacted COVID-19
mortality. Each of these approaches provides a valuable perspective to
documenting inequities in COVID-19 mortality by addressing the question of
which populations have suffered the worst burden of COVID-19 mortality taking
into account the nonlinear spatial, temporal, and social patterning of disease.

Titre du document Arxiv : Unsupervised Text Mining of COVID-19 Records
Auteur : ['Mohamad Zamini']
Texte : Since the beginning of coronavirus, the disease has spread worldwide and
drastically changed many aspects of the human's lifestyle. Twitter as a
powerful tool can help researchers measure public health in response to
COVID-19. According to the high volume of data production on social networks,
automated text mining approaches can help search, read and summarize helpful
information. This paper preprocessed the existing medical dataset regarding
COVID-19 named CORD-19 and annotated the dataset for supervised classification
tasks. At this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, we made a preprocessed dataset
for the research community. This may contribute towards finding new solutions
for some social interventions that COVID-19 has made. The preprocessed version
of the mentioned dataset is publicly available through Github.

Titre du document Arxiv : Using A Partial Differential Equation with Google Mobility Data to
  Predict COVID-19 in Arizona
Auteur : ['Haiyan Wang', 'Nao Yamamoto']
Texte : The outbreak of COVID-19 disrupts the life of many people in the world. The
state of Arizona in the U.S. emerges as one of the country's newest COVID-19
hot spots. Accurate forecasting for COVID-19 cases will help governments to
implement necessary measures and convince more people to take personal
precautions to combat the virus. It is difficult to accurately predict the
COVID-19 cases due to many human factors involved. This paper aims to provide a
forecasting model for COVID-19 cases with the help of human activity data from
the Google Community Mobility Reports. To achieve this goal, a specific partial
differential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with the COVID-19 data
from the New York Times at the county level in the state of Arizona in the U.S.
The proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among
county clusters in Arizona and human actives on the transmission of COVID-19.
The results show that the prediction accuracy of this model is well acceptable
(above 94\%). Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of personal precautions
such as wearing face masks and practicing social distancing on COVID-19 cases
at the local level. The localized analytical results can be used to help to
slow the spread of COVID-19 in Arizona. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is the first attempt to apply PDE models on COVID-19 prediction with the Google
Community Mobility Reports.

Titre du document Arxiv : Vital Measurements of Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients as a Predictor of
  Long COVID: An EHR-based Cohort Study from the RECOVER Program in N3C
Auteur : ['Sihang Jiang', 'Johanna Loomba', 'Suchetha Sharma', 'Donald Brown']
Texte : It is shown that various symptoms could remain in the stage of post-acute
sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), otherwise known as Long COVID. A
number of COVID patients suffer from heterogeneous symptoms, which severely
impact recovery from the pandemic. While scientists are trying to give an
unambiguous definition of Long COVID, efforts in prediction of Long COVID could
play an important role in understanding the characteristic of this new disease.
Vital measurements (e.g. oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure) could
reflect body's most basic functions and are measured regularly during
hospitalization, so among patients diagnosed COVID positive and hospitalized,
we analyze the vital measurements of first 7 days since the hospitalization
start date to study the pattern of the vital measurements and predict Long
COVID with the information from vital measurements.

Titre du document Arxiv : When the Open Source Community Meets COVID-19: Characterizing COVID-19
  themed GitHub Repositories
Auteur : ['Liu Wang', 'Ruiqing Li', 'Jiaxin Zhu', 'Guangdong Bai', 'Haoyu Wang']
Texte : Ever since the beginning of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,
researchers from interdisciplinary domains have worked together to fight
against the crisis. The open source community, plays a vital role in coping
with the pandemic which is inherently a collaborative process. Plenty of
COVID-19 related datasets, tools, software, deep learning models, are created
and shared in research communities with great efforts. However, COVID-19 themed
open source projects have not been systematically studied, and we are still
unaware how the open source community helps combat COVID-19 in practice. To
fill this void, in this paper, we take the first step to study COVID-19 themed
repositories in GitHub, one of the most popular collaborative platforms. We
have collected over 67K COVID-19 themed GitHub repositories till July 2020. We
then characterize them from a number of aspects and classify them into six
categories. We further investigate the contribution patterns of the
contributors, and development and maintenance patterns of the repositories.
This study sheds light on the promising direction of adopting open source
technologies and resources to rapidly tackle the worldwide public health
emergency in practice, and reveals existing challenges for improvement.
